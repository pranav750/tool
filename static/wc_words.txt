 About this page 

Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network.  This page checks to see if it's really you sending the requests, and not a robot.   Why did this happen? 
 
This page appears when Google automatically detects requests coming from your computer network which appear to be in violation of the  Terms of Service . The block will expire shortly after those requests stop.  In the meantime, solving the above CAPTCHA will let you continue to use our services. This traffic may have been sent by malicious software, a browser plug-in, or a script that sends automated requests.  If you share your network connection, ask your administrator for help — a different computer using the same IP address may be responsible.   Learn more Sometimes you may be asked to solve the CAPTCHA if you are using advanced terms that robots are known to use, or sending requests very quickly.

 Using software that sends searches to Google to see how a website or webpage ranks on Google 
 
 What to do when you see this message

 Common issues 
 I don't see a reCAPTCHA 
 
 If you don't see a reCAPTCHA, try these steps in order: 
 
 Check for malware on your computer. Malware is malicious software that can be installed on your computer without your knowledge. Some malware can cause Google to show this message. Learn how to  detect and remove malware . 
 Contact your network administrator. If you share a Wi-Fi network with others, like at a school or business, another computer in your network might be sending automated searches to Google. Your network administrator or IT professional might be able to locate and stop the source of the problem. 
 Reset your modem or router. If you don't have a network administrator, try resetting your modem or router to see if that fixes the issue. 
 
 Once the automated searches have stopped, you should be able to search normally on Google. 
 
 I shouldn't be getting blocked 
 
 The blocking might be related to your use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) browser plugin or program. You might try uninstalling the VPN from your computer or network and see if that makes a difference. 
 Some VPNs send traffic that violates the law or websites' terms of service. If you're an Internet Service Provider (ISP), explain to your users why they should uninstall these VPNs. When the abuse to Google's network stops, we automatically stop blocking the IP(s)/ISP(s) that were sending the bad traffic.
