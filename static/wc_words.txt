Aakash Arya Updated: February 04, 2022 07:33 PM IST Read Time: 4 min facebook   twitter   whatsapp   reddit   Snapchat   kooapp E-mail   Printer   Pakistan's Qasim Akram scored a century before taking five wickets against Bangladesh. © Twitter Pakistan U19  cricket team's skipper Qasim Akram stole the limelight during his team's 5th place playoff game against Sri Lanka in the ongoing  ICC U19 World Cup 2022 . Akram batted beautifully to remain unbeaten on 135 runs and then returned to haunt the Sri Lanka batters with the ball as he claimed a memorable five-wicket haul as well. This herculean all-round effort helped Pakistan go past Sri Lanka by 238 runs eventually. The ICC shared an Instagram post revealing that Akram's feat of a century and five wickets in the same match was a first of its kind in the tournament's history. Here's what ICC shared on Instagram: "The first player in #U19CWC history to score a century and take a five-wicket haul in the same match! Pakistan's Qasim Akram certainly stamped his mark on the tournament." View this post on Instagram A post shared by ICC (@icc) Batting first, Pakistan scored 365/3 in their 50 overs. Apart from Akram, Haseebullah Khan also scored an unbeaten ton while opener Muhammad Shehzad played a superb knock of 73 runs. In reply, Akram broke the backbone of the opposition as he dismissed the top five batters cheaply to set up the game for his team. Akram also played a part in Anjala Bandara's run-out to cap off a historic day.

 Cricket  is a  bat-and-ball game  played between two teams of eleven players each on a  field  at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre)  pitch  with a  wicket  at each end, each comprising two  bails  balanced on three  stumps . The game  proceeds  when a player on the  fielding team , called the  bowler , "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an " over " being completed once they have legally done so six times. The  batting side  has one player at each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat. The batting side scores  runs  either when the ball reaches the  boundary  of the field, or when the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run. The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and  dismiss  each batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket"). Means of dismissal include being  bowled , when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either  catching  a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball  before  a batter can cross the  crease line  in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have been dismissed, the  innings  ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two  umpires , aided by a  third umpire  and  match referee  in international matches.
 Forms of cricket  range from  Twenty20 , with each team batting for a single innings of 20  overs  and the game generally lasting three hours, to  Test matches  played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white  kit , but in  limited overs cricket  they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear  protective gear  to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed  leather  with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a  cork  core layered with tightly wound string.
 The earliest reference to cricket is in  South East England  in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the  British Empire , with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the  International Cricket Council  (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are  full members  who play Test matches. The game's rules, the  Laws of Cricket , are maintained by  Marylebone Cricket Club  (MCC) in  London . The sport is followed primarily in  South Asia , Australasia, the United Kingdom,  southern Africa  and the  West Indies . [1] 
 Women's cricket , which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most successful side playing  international cricket  is  Australia , which has won seven  One Day International  trophies, including five  World Cups , more than any other country and has been the  top-rated Test side  more than any other country.

 Main article:  History of cricket to 1725 
   A medieval "club ball" game involving an underhand bowl towards a batter. Ball catchers are shown positioning themselves to catch a ball. Detail from the  Canticles of Holy Mary , 13th century. 
 Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others include  baseball  (which shares many  similarities  with cricket, both belonging in the more specific  bat-and-ball games  category [2] ),  golf ,  hockey ,  tennis ,  squash ,  badminton  and  table tennis . [3]  In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend. [4]  The cricket historian  Harry Altham  identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and fro between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it". [5] 
 It is generally believed that cricket originated as a  children's game  in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the  medieval period . [4]  Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in  Guildford  in January 1597 ( Old Style ), equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar. The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old  coroner ,  John Derrick , who gave witness that: [6] [7] [8] 
 
 Being a scholler in the  ffree schoole of Guldeford  hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies. 
 Given Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c. 1550 by boys in  Surrey . [8]  The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced by  Randle Cotgrave 's 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun " crosse "  as "the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket" and the verb form " crosser "  as "to play at cricket". [9] [10] 
 One possible source for the sport's name is the  Old English  word " cryce "  (or " cricc " ) meaning a crutch or staff. In  Samuel Johnson 's  Dictionary , he derived cricket from " cryce , Saxon, a stick". [6]  In  Old French , the word " criquet "  seems to have meant a kind of club or stick. [11]  Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the  County of Flanders  when the latter belonged to the  Duchy of Burgundy , the name may have been derived from the  Middle Dutch  (in use in  Flanders  at the time) " krick " ( -e ), meaning a stick (crook). [11]  Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word " krickstoel " , meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low  wicket  with two  stumps  used in early cricket. [12]  According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of  Bonn University , "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for  hockey ,  met de (krik ket)sen  (i.e., "with the stick chase"). [13]  Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin. [13] 
 
 Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England 
   Evolution of the cricket bat. The original " hockey stick " (left) evolved into the straight bat from c. 1760 when  pitched delivery bowling  began. 
 Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most  runs , the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known as  wicket  retained many of these aspects. [14]  The  ball  was  bowled underarm  by the  bowler  and along the ground towards a  batter  armed with a  bat  that in shape resembled a  hockey stick ; the batter defended a low, two-stump  wicket ; and runs were called notches because the  scorers  recorded them by notching tally sticks. [15] [16] [17] 
 In 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published,  ecclesiastical court  records at  Sidlesham  in  Sussex  state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12 d  each and ordered to do  penance . [18]  This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or  village  match was played – at  Chevening, Kent . [6] [19]  In 1624, a player called  Jasper Vinall  died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex. [20] 
 Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century. [10]  It is known, through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the  Puritans  before and during the  Commonwealth . [21] [22]  The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be "profane" if played on the  Sabbath , especially if large crowds or  gambling  were involved. [23] [24] 
 According to the social historian  Derek Birley , there was a "great upsurge of sport after the  Restoration " in 1660. [25]  Several members of the court of King  Charles II  took a strong interest in cricket during that era. [26]  Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to £100 which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population. [25]  Along with  prizefighting ,  horse racing  and blood sports, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport. [27]  Rich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players. [28]  By the end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676. [29]  A 1697 newspaper report survives of "a great cricket match" played in Sussex "for fifty guineas apiece" – this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a  First Class  match. [30] [31] 
 The patrons, and other players from the social class known as the " gentry ", began to classify themselves as " amateurs " [fn 1]  to establish a clear distinction from the professionals, who were invariably members of the  working class , even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities. [32]  The gentry, including such high-ranking nobles as the  Dukes of Richmond , exerted their honour code of  noblesse oblige  to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in, especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their "social inferiors" if they were to win their bets. [33]  In time, a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in first-class cricket, until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with a  public school  education who had then gone to one of  Cambridge  or  Oxford University  – society insisted that such people were "officers and gentlemen" whose destiny was to provide leadership. [34]  In a purely financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term "shamateur" was coined to describe the practice. [35] [36] 
 
 English cricket in the 18th and 19th centuries 
   Francis Cotes ,  The Young Cricketer , 1768 
 The game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England's national sport. [37]  Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting. [38]  Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the  Artillery Ground  in Finsbury. [ citation needed ]  The  single wicket  form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the  1748 season . [39]  Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to  pitch the ball  instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batter. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the  bouncing ball , it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old "hockey stick" shape. [40] [ citation needed ] 
 The  Hambledon Club  was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of  Marylebone Cricket Club  (MCC) and the opening of  Lord's Old Ground  in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. [ citation needed ]  MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the  Laws of Cricket . New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and  leg before wicket  (lbw). [41] 
 The 19th century saw  underarm bowling  superseded by first  roundarm  and then  overarm bowling . Both developments were controversial. [42]  Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with  Sussex  in 1839. [43]  In December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the official  County Championship , which began in 1890. [44] 
 The most famous player of the 19th century was  W. G. Grace , who started his long and influential career in 1865. It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but, in terms of their financial gain,  de facto  professional. Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professional. [ citation needed ] 
 The last two decades before the  First World War  have been called the " Golden Age of cricket ". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed. [45] 
 
 Cricket becomes an international sport 
   The first English team to tour overseas, on board ship to North America, 1859 
 In 1844, the  first-ever international match  took place between what were essentially club teams, from the  United States  and  Canada , in  Toronto ; Canada won. [46] [47]  In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on  the first overseas tour . [48]  Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in Australia, the Caribbean, British India (which includes present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh), New Zealand, North America and South Africa. [49] 
 In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia. [50]  The first Australian team to travel overseas consisted of  Aboriginal   stockmen  which  toured England in 1868 . [51]  The first One Day International match was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the  Melbourne Cricket Ground . [52] 
 In 1876–77, an  England team  took part in what was retrospectively recognized as the first-ever  Test match  at the  Melbourne Cricket Ground  against  Australia . [53]  The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to  The Ashes  in 1882, and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest. [54]  Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when  South Africa  played England. [55] 
 
 World cricket in the 20th century 
   Don Bradman  of  Australia  had a record Test batting average of 99.94. 
 The inter-war years were dominated by  Australia 's  Don Bradman , statistically the greatest Test batter of all time. Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the  West Indies  (1928),  New Zealand  (1930) and  India  (1932) before the Second World War and then  Pakistan  (1952),  Sri Lanka  (1982),  Zimbabwe  (1992),  Bangladesh  (2000),  Ireland  and  Afghanistan  (both 2018) in the post-war period. [56] [57]   South Africa  was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 as part of the  apartheid boycott . [58] 
 
 The rise of limited overs cricket 
 Cricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the  limited overs  variant. [59]  As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased. [60]  The first  Limited Overs International  was played in 1971 and the governing  International Cricket Council  (ICC), seeing its potential, staged the first limited overs  Cricket World Cup  in 1975. [61]  In the 21st century, a new limited overs form,  Twenty20 , made an immediate impact. [ citation needed ]  On 22 June 2017,  Afghanistan  and  Ireland  became the 11th and 12th ICC full members, enabling them to play  Test cricket . [62] [63] 
 
 Laws and gameplay 
 Main article:  Laws of Cricket 
   A typical  cricket field . 
 In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called  The Laws of Cricket  (hereinafter called "the Laws") which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the  Marylebone Cricket Club  (MCC) in London. [64] 
 
 Playing area 
 Main articles:  Cricket field ,  Cricket pitch ,  Crease (cricket) , and  Wicket 
 Cricket is a  bat-and-ball game  played on a  cricket field  (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players each. [65]  The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a  boundary , which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length. [66] 
 In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular  pitch  (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a  wicket  is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart. [67]  The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden  stumps  topped by two  bails . [68] 
 
   Cricket pitch and creases 
 As illustrated above, the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: a  bowling crease , a  popping crease  and two  return creases . The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), it is, in fact, unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length. [69] 
 
 Match structure and closure 
 Main articles:  Innings  and  Result (cricket) 
   A modern  SG  cricket bat (back view). 
 Before a match begins, the team  captains  (who are also players)  toss a coin  to decide which team will bat first and so take the first  innings . [70]   Innings  is the term used for each phase of play in the match. [70]  In each innings, one team  bats , attempting to  score   runs , while the other team  bowls  and  fields  the  ball , attempting to restrict the scoring and  dismiss  the batters. [71] [72]  When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match. A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day. [70]  During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time. The exception to this is if a batter has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run, in this case the batter is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batter hits a scoring run or runs, [73]  though this does not apply in international cricket. [74]  The order of batters is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied. [65] 
 The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but, in some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batters in their final innings in order to win the match, which would otherwise be  drawn . [75]  If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have "lost by  n  runs" (where  n  is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have "won by  n  wickets", where  n  is the number of wickets left to fall. For example, a team that passes its opponents' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batters have been  dismissed ) have won the match "by four wickets". [75] 
 In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have "won by an innings and  n  runs", and does not need to bat again:  n  is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores. If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a  tie ; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening in  first-class matches  from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017. In the  traditional form  of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a  draw . [75] 
 If the match has only a single innings per side, then usually a maximum number of  overs  applies to each innings. Such a match is called a " limited overs " or "one-day" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. In some cases, ties are broken by having each team bat for a one-over innings known as a  Super Over ; subsequent Super Overs may be played if the first Super Over ends in a tie. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the  Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method  after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a "no-result" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather. [75] 
 In all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue. [76]  There have been instances of entire matches, even  Test matches  scheduled to be played over five days, being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled: for example, the third Test of the 1970/71 series in Australia. [77] 
 
 Innings 
 Main article:  Innings 
 The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is "all out", a term defined by the Laws: "at the  fall of a wicket  or the retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is available to come in". [70]  In this situation, one of the batters has not been dismissed and is termed  not out ; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batters while the innings is in progress.
 An innings may end early while there are still two not out batters: [70] 
 
 the batting team's  captain   may declare the innings closed  even though some of his players have not had a turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings 
 the set number of  overs  (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been bowled 
 the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time 
 in the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game. 
 Overs 
 Main article:  Over (cricket) 
 The Laws state that, throughout an innings, "the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls". [78]  The name "over" came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batters do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a "spell". The batters do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at "square leg" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa. [78] 
 
 Clothing and equipment 
 Main article:  Cricket clothing and equipment 
   English cricketer  W. G. Grace  "taking guard" in 1883. His pads and bat are very similar to those used today. The gloves have evolved somewhat. Many modern players use more defensive equipment than were available to Grace, most notably helmets and arm guards. 
 The wicket-keeper (a specialised fielder behind the batter) and the batters wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and presents a major health and safety concern. Protective clothing includes  pads  (designed to protect the knees and shins),  batting gloves  or  wicket-keeper's gloves  for the hands, a  safety helmet  for the head and a  box  for male players inside the trousers (to protect the  crotch  area). [79]  Some batters wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batter (i.e., if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards. [80] 
 Subject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woolen pullover (if needed);  cricket cap  (for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction. The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket but, in limited overs cricket, team colours are worn instead. [81] 
 
 Bat and ball 
 Main articles:  Cricket bat  and  Cricket ball 
 Two types of  cricket ball , both of the same size:
 i) A used white ball. White balls are mainly used in  limited overs cricket , especially in matches played at night, under  floodlights  (left). 
 
ii) A used red ball. Red balls are used in  Test cricket ,  first-class cricket  and some other forms of cricket (right). 
 The essence of the sport is that a  bowler   delivers  (i.e., bowls) the  ball  from his or her end of the  pitch  towards the  batter  who, armed with a  bat , is "on strike" at the other end (see next sub-section:  Basic gameplay ).
 The  bat  is made of wood, usually  Salix alba  (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches (97 cm). There is no standard for the weight, which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1.1 and 1.4 kg). [82] [83] 
 The  ball  is a hard leather-seamed  spheroid , with a circumference of 9 inches (23 cm). The ball has a "seam": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable;  during the course of this deterioration, its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's  swing through the air , but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam are illegal  ball tampering . [84] 
 
 Player roles 
 Basic gameplay: bowler to batter 
 During normal play, thirteen players and two  umpires  are on the field. Two of the players are batters and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team. The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the  pavilion . The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch. [85] 
 
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 1 Umpire 2 Wicket 3 Non-striking batter 4 Bowler 5 Ball 6 Pitch 7 Popping crease 8 Striking batter 9 Wicket 10 Wicket-keeper 11 First slip 12 Return crease 
 In the photo, the two  batters  (3 & 8; wearing yellow) have taken position at each end of the  pitch  (6). Three members of the  fielding  team (4, 10 & 11; wearing dark blue) are in shot. One of the two umpires (1; wearing white hat) is stationed behind the  wicket  (2) at the  bowler's  (4) end of the pitch. The bowler (4) is  bowling  the  ball  (5) from his end of the pitch to the batter (8) at the other end who is called the "striker". The other batter (3) at the bowling end is called the "non-striker". The  wicket-keeper  (10), who is a specialist, is positioned behind the striker's wicket (9) and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called " first slip " (11). While the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only, the two batters and the wicket-keeper are wearing protective gear including safety helmets, padded gloves and leg guards (pads).
 While the umpire (1) in shot stands at the bowler's end of the pitch, his colleague stands in the outfield, usually in or near the fielding position called " square leg ", so that he is in line with the  popping crease  (7) at the striker's end of the pitch. The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases (12). The bowler (4) intends to hit the wicket (9) with the ball (5) or, at least, to prevent the striker (8) from scoring  runs . The striker (8) intends, by using his bat, to defend his wicket and, if possible, to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs.
 Some players are skilled in both batting and bowling, or as either or these as well as wicket-keeping, so are termed  all-rounders .  Bowlers are classified according to their style, generally as  fast bowlers ,  seam bowlers  or  spinners . Batters are classified according to whether they are right-handed or left-handed.
 
 Fielding 
 Main article:  Fielding (cricket) 
   Fielding positions in cricket  for a right-handed batter 
 Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. The other eight are elsewhere on the field, their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler. Fielders often change position between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or bowler. [80] 
 If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a  substitute  is allowed to field instead of him, but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket. [74]  The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return. [86]  The Laws of Cricket were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers. [87] 
 
 Bowling and dismissal 
 Main articles:  Bowling (cricket)  and  Dismissal (cricket) 
   Glenn McGrath  of  Australia  holds the world record for most wickets in the  Cricket World Cup . [88] 
 Most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler, although some are all-rounders and even specialist batters bowl occasionally. The specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively. If the captain wants a bowler to "change ends", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate. [78] 
 A bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a "run-up" and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run-up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being "in play". [78]  Fast bowlers, needing momentum, take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batter, who is forced to react very quickly. [89]  Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball  seam  or  swing  (i.e. curve) in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batter into miscuing his shot, for example, so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be "caught behind" by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder. [89]  At the other end of the bowling scale is the  spin bowler  who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batter. A spinner will often "buy his wicket" by "tossing one up" (in a slower, steeper  parabolic  path) to lure the batter into making a poor shot. The batter has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often "flighted" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be "trapped" into getting himself out. [90]  In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batter's concentration. [89] 
 There are nine ways in which a batter can be dismissed: five relatively common and four extremely rare. The common forms of dismissal are  bowled , [91]   caught , [92]   leg before wicket  (lbw), [93]   run out [94]  and  stumped . [95]  Rare methods are  hit wicket , [96]   hit the ball twice , [97]   obstructing the field [98]  and  timed out . [99]  The Laws state that the fielding team, usually the bowler in practice, must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision. If the batter is out, the umpire raises a forefinger and says "Out!"; otherwise, he will shake his head and say "Not out". [100]  There is, effectively, a tenth method of dismissal,  retired out , which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited. [101] 
 
 Batting, runs and extras 
 Main articles:  Batting (cricket) ,  Run (cricket) , and  Extra (cricket) 
   The directions in which a right-handed batter, facing down the page, intends to send the ball when playing various cricketing shots. The diagram for a  left-handed  batter is a  mirror image  of this one. 
 Batters take turns to bat via a  batting order  which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team. [65]  Substitute batters are generally not allowed, [86]  except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket. [74] 
 In order to begin batting the batter first adopts a batting stance. Standardly, this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot. [102] 
 A skilled batter can use a wide array of "shots" or "strokes" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an " edge ". The batter does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the  wicketkeeper . Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. Batters do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply "blocking" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batter's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., " cut ", "drive", "hook", "pull". [103] 
 The batter on strike (i.e. the "striker") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score  runs  by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batters carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker. [104] 
 
   Sachin Tendulkar  is the only player to have scored one hundred international  centuries 
 The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batter who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: usually "yes", "no" or "wait". More than one run can be scored from a single hit: hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more. [104]  To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground  en route  to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In these cases the batters do not need to run. [105]  Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of "overthrows" by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batters have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total. [104] 
 Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as  extras  (called "sundries" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways:  no-ball , a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules; [106]   wide , a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batter's reach; [107]   bye , an extra awarded if the batter misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batters time to run in the conventional way; [108]   leg bye , as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batter's body, though not his bat. [108]  If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball. [106] [107] 
 
 Specialist roles 
 Main articles:  Captain (cricket)  and  Wicket-keeper 
 The captain is often the most experienced player in the team, certainly the most tactically astute, and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batter, a bowler or a wicket-keeper. Within the Laws, the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves "within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws". [65] 
 The wicket-keeper (sometimes called simply the "keeper") is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about his equipment and demeanour. He is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a  stumping  and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. [109]  Depending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batters or specialist bowlers. Generally, a team will include five or six specialist batters and four or five specialist bowlers, plus the wicket-keeper. [110] [111] 
 
 Umpires and scorers 
 Main articles:  Umpire (cricket) ,  Scoring (cricket) , and  Cricket statistics 
   An umpire signals a decision to the scorers 
 The game on the field is regulated by the two  umpires , one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called "square leg" which is about 15–20 metres away from the batter on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard. The umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.e., not a  no-ball  or a  wide ); when a run is scored; whether a batter is out (the fielding side must first  appeal  to the umpire, usually with the phrase "How's that?" or "Owzat?"); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light. [76] 
 Off the field in televised matches, there is usually a  third umpire  who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for  Test  and  Limited Overs International  matches played between two ICC full member countries. These matches also have a  match referee  whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game. [76] 
 The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official  scorers , one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right). For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batter is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batter has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game. [112] 
 A match's  statistics  are summarised on a scorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on  tally sticks  and runs were originally called notches. [113]  According to  Rowland Bowen , the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in 1776 by T. Pratt of  Sevenoaks  and soon came into general use. [114]  It is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at  Lord's  for the first time in 1846. [115] 
 
 Spirit of the Game 
 Main article:  Laws of Cricket 
 Besides observing the Laws, cricketers must respect the "Spirit of Cricket", a concept encompassing  sportsmanship , fair play and mutual respect. This spirit has long been considered an integral part of the sport but is only nebulously defined. Amidst concern that the spirit was weakening, in 2000 a Preamble was added to the Laws instructing all participants to play within the spirit of the game. The Preamble was last updated in 2017, now opening with the line: [116] 
 
 "Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only
according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket". 
 The Preamble is a short statement intended to emphasise the "positive behaviours that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship, and teamwork." [117]  Its second line states that "the major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all
players, match officials and, especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents." [116] 
 The umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play. They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player.
 Previous versions of the Spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary (for example, appealing knowing that the batter is not out) but all specifics are now covered in the Laws of Cricket, the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes, or left to the judgement of the umpires, captains, their clubs and governing bodies. The terse expression of the Spirit of Cricket now avoids the diversity of cultural conventions that exist in the detail of sportsmanship – or its absence.
 
 Women's cricket 
 Main article:  Women's cricket 
   Mithali Raj  of India, is the only player to surpass the 6,000 run mark in  Women's One Day International cricket . 
 Women's cricket  was first recorded in  Surrey  in 1745. [118]  International development began at the start of the 20th century and the first Test Match was played between  Australia  and  England  in December 1934. [119]  The following year,  New Zealand  women joined them, and in 2007  Netherlands women  became the tenth women's Test nation when they made their debut against  South Africa women . In 1958, the International Women's Cricket Council was founded (it merged with the ICC in 2005). [119]  In 1973, the first Cricket World Cup of any kind took place when a Women's World Cup was held in England. [119]   In 2005, the  International Women's Cricket Council  was merged with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form one unified body to help manage and develop cricket. The ICC Women's Rankings were launched on 1 October 2015 covering all three formats of women's cricket. In October 2018 following the ICC's decision to award T20 International status to all members, the Women's rankings were split into separate  ODI  (for Full Members) and T20I lists. [120]

   ICC  member nations. The (highest level) Test playing nations are shown in red; the associate member nations are shown in orange, with those with  ODI status  in a darker shade; suspended or former members are shown in dark grey. 
 The  International Cricket Council  (ICC), which has its headquarters in  Dubai , is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and took up its current name in 1989. [119]  The ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and can play  Test cricket . [121]  The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the men's and women's versions of the  Cricket World Cup . It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.
 Each member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, selects the national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team. [122]  In the West Indies, which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed by  Cricket West Indies . [123]

 Forms of cricket 
 Main article:  Forms of cricket 
   A  Test match  between South Africa and England in January 2005. The men wearing black trousers are the  umpires . Teams in Test cricket,  first-class cricket  and  club cricket  wear traditional white uniforms and use red  cricket balls . 
 Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into  first-class cricket ,  limited overs cricket  and, historically,  single wicket cricket . The highest standard is  Test cricket  (always written with a capital "T") which is in effect the international version of first-class cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC (see above). Although the term "Test match" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between  Australia  and  England  in the  1876–77 Australian season ; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as  The Ashes . The term "first-class", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket. Test matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result. [126] 
 Limited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day, and the teams are allotted one innings each. There are two types:  List A  which normally allows fifty overs per team; and  Twenty20  in which the teams have twenty overs each. Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as  Limited Overs Internationals  (LOI) and  Twenty20 Internationals  (T20I). List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the first  Cricket World Cup  took place in England. Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session. The first  Twenty20 World Championship  was held in 2007. Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a "no result". [127] [128] 
 Single wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches were generally considered top-class. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batter in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw. [129] 
 
 Competitions 
 Cricket is played at both the international and domestic level. There is one major international championship per format, and top-level domestic competitions mirror the three main international formats. There are now a number of  T20 leagues , which have spawned a "T20 freelancer" phenomenon. [130] 
 
 International competitions 
 Main article:  International cricket 
 Most international matches are played as parts of 'tours', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months, and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. Sometimes a  perpetual trophy  is awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which is  The Ashes .
 The ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the  Cricket World Cup ,  ICC T20 World Cup  and  ICC Champions Trophy . A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the  ICC World Test Championship , had been proposed several times, and its  first instance  began in 2019. A league competition for ODIs, the  ICC Cricket World Cup Super League , began in August 2020. The ICC maintains  Test rankings ,  ODI rankings  and  T20 rankings  systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket.
 Competitions for member nations of the ICC with  Associate status  include the  ICC Intercontinental Cup , for first-class cricket matches, and the  World Cricket League  for one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as the  ICC World Cup Qualifier .

   Yorkshire County Cricket Club  in 1895. The team first won the County Championship in 1893. 
 First-class 
 Main article:  List of current first-class cricket teams 
 First-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the  County Championship . The concept of a  champion county  has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890. [44]  The most successful club has been  Yorkshire , who had won 32 official titles (plus one shared) as of 2019. [131] 
 Australia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the  Sheffield Shield  was introduced. In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states. [132]   New South Wales  has the highest number of titles.
 The other ICC full members have national championship trophies called the  Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament  (Afghanistan); the  National Cricket League  (Bangladesh); the  Ranji Trophy  (India); the  Inter-Provincial Championship  (Ireland); the  Plunket Shield  (New Zealand); the  Quaid-e-Azam Trophy  (Pakistan); the  Currie Cup  (South Africa); the  Premier Trophy  (Sri Lanka); the  Shell Shield  (West Indies); and the  Logan Cup  (Zimbabwe).

 The world's earliest known cricket match was a  village cricket  meeting in  Kent  which has been deduced from a 1640 court case recording a "cricketing" of "the Weald and the Upland" versus "the Chalk Hill" at  Chevening  "about thirty years since" (i.e.,  c.  1611 ). Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century and continued to develop through the 18th with the first local leagues being founded in the second half of the 19th. [19] 
 At the grassroots level, local  club cricket  is essentially an amateur pastime for those involved but still usually involves teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening.  Schools cricket , first known in southern England in the 17th century, has a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular. [133]  Although there can be variations in game format, compared with professional cricket, the Laws are always observed and club/school matches are therefore formal and competitive events. [134]  The sport has numerous informal variants such as  French cricket . [135] 
 
 Culture 
 Main page:  Category:Cricket culture 
 Influence on everyday life 
 Cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the  Commonwealth of Nations  and elsewhere. It has, for example, influenced the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with various phrases such as "that's not cricket" (that's unfair), "had a good  innings " (lived a long life) and " sticky wicket ". "On a sticky wicket" ( aka  "sticky dog" or "glue pot") [136]  is a  metaphor [137]  used to describe a difficult circumstance. It originated as a term for difficult batting conditions in cricket, caused by a damp and soft pitch. [138] 
 
 In the arts and popular culture 
 See also:  Cricket in fiction ,  Cricket in film and television , and  Cricket poetry 
 Cricket is the subject of works by noted English poets, including  William Blake  and  Lord Byron . [139]   Beyond a Boundary  (1963), written by Trinidadian  C. L. R. James , is often named the best book on any sport ever written. [140] 
 
   Tom Wills , cricketer and co-founder of  Australian football 
 In the visual arts, notable cricket paintings include  Albert Chevallier Tayler 's  Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury  (1907) and  Russell Drysdale 's  The Cricketers  (1948), which has been called "possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century." [141]  French  impressionist   Camille Pissarro  painted cricket on a visit to England in the 1890s. [139]   Francis Bacon , an avid cricket fan, captured a batter in motion. [139]   Caribbean  artist  Wendy Nanan 's cricket images [142]  are featured in a limited edition first day cover for  Royal Mail 's "World of Invention" stamp issue, which celebrated the London Cricket Conference 1–3 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the celebrations leading up to the 2007  Cricket World Cup . [143] 
 
 Influence on other sports 
 Cricket has close historical ties with  Australian rules football  and many players have  competed at top levels in both sports . [144]  In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer  Tom Wills  called for the formation of a "foot-ball club" with "a code of laws" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season. The  Melbourne Football Club  was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game. [145]  It is typically played on  modified cricket fields . [146] 
 In England, a number of  association football  clubs owe their origins to cricketers who sought to play football as a means of keeping fit during the winter months.  Derby County  was founded as a branch of the  Derbyshire County Cricket Club  in 1884; [147]   Aston Villa  (1874) and  Everton  (1876) were both founded by members of church cricket teams. [148]   Sheffield United 's  Bramall Lane  ground was, from 1854, the home of the  Sheffield Cricket Club , and then of  Yorkshire ; it was not used for football until 1862 and was shared by Yorkshire and Sheffield United from 1889 to 1973. [149] 
 In the late 19th century, a former cricketer, English-born  Henry Chadwick  of  Brooklyn , New York, was credited with devising the baseball  box score [150]  (which he adapted from the cricket scorecard) for reporting game events. The first box score appeared in an 1859 issue of the  Clipper . [151]  The statistical record is so central to the game's "historical essence" that Chadwick is sometimes referred to as "the Father of Baseball" because he facilitated the popularity of the sport in its early days. [152]

While the definition may have worked back in the 16th century when it was first played in South-East England, it may receive unfavourable support now. We are now living in the 21 st century, and as things have undergone changes, evolution so to speak, the gentleman’s game too has evolved into becoming something bigger. Though initially stated to be a children’s game by historians, the game has only gone on to become sophisticated and technical, and hence no longer just a game of bat-and-ball.

In order to celebrate what we have currently, we ought to honour the past as well. And to take a little walk down the line in regard to the game of cricket, we go to England in the old days. Although cricket now attracts money from all corners, it started its journey as a low-profile sport not pursued by many. Slowly and gradually, the game started getting its recognition. Since then, cricket has also been able to create a junction where different category of people could compete, but most importantly enjoy the same sport. The same movement was triggered in India, when the East India Company introduced to game to the Indian masses. The revered Bombay Quadrangular (held from 1912 to 1936) is one such example.

The longest format of the game, Test cricket, has continued to exist even after so many years. In the early 1960s, and once again the story moves to England and its counties,  the need for a limited overs format was discussed. The changes were duly made, both domestically and internationally. This meant that the sport would now have a World Cup of its own. When we talk about limited overs format, we are only talking about One day internationals right now since the very popular T20 cricket comes much later in the timeline. The main reason why One Day internationals became a popular choice was because by the end of the game, you surely had just one winner. This paved way for the cricket world cup, which has been played every four years since 1975, with few exceptions in between. During this time, there was a rise in cricket governing bodies. With a new format, there were new teams. The figures were only to increase, with the entry of the shortest format of the game, T20s.

Originally introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), T20 games were introduced in 2003 for the inter-county competition. The first men's international T20 match was played between Australia and New Zealand in February 2005 in Auckland. The newest format, the shortest one on the list, provided astonishing moments. One can think about India’s win in the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, a campaign which included remarkable moments.  

The game of cricket, whenever altered to provide something new, always leads to a new option. With T20, cricket’s own club competition system was introduced. Twenty-twenty gave birth to franchise T20 leagues around the world. The Indian Premier League (IPL), one of the flagship T20 leagues, is probably the best example. This gave fans a chance to watch thrillers on the ground more often than usual. Franchise based T20 cricket tournaments also became huge money spinners, with sponsors jumping onto the T20 franchise cricket bandwagon Trending now in Sports Prithvi Shaw Ishan Kishan Robin Uthappa Dinesh Karthik Kedhar Jadhav David Miller Sanju Samson Gautam Gambhir Kieron Pollard Faf Du Plessis Ben Stokes Rashid Khan Sunil Narine Chris Gayle Krunal Pandya Moeen Ali Joe Root Jos Butler Suryakumar Yadav Eion Morgan Glen Maxwell Shubman Gill Andre Russel Steve Smith David Warner Nitish Rana Ravi Shastri Virender Sehwag Chahal Shikhar Dhawan Shardul Thakur Rishabh Pant Parthiv Patel Manish Pandey Mandeep Singh Kedhar Jadhav Karun Nair Hardik Pandya Dhawal Kulakarni Axar Patel Ashish Nehra Amit Mishra Ambati Rayudu Yuvraj Singh W Saha Umesh Yadav Rohit Sharma Mohammed Shami KL Rahul Jasprit Bumrah Ishant Sharma Bhuvneshwar Kumar Ravindra Jadeja R Ashwin Murali Vijay MS Dhoni Pujara Ajinkya Rahane Virat Kohli Other Times Group news sites The Economic Times Hindi Economic Times Navbharat Times Maharashtra Times Vijaya Karnataka Telugu Samayam Tamil Samayam Malayalam Samayam Ei Samay I am Gujarat Times Now Times Now Navbharat TimesPoints Indiatimes Brand Capital Education Times Times Food Miss Kyra Mumbai Mirror Bangalore Mirror MX Player Hindi Podcast Bengali Podcast MX ShareKaro MX TakaTak App Living and entertainment iDiva  MensXP.com  Femina  ETimes Grazia  Zoom  Travel Destinations  Bombay Times  Cricbuzz.com  Filmfare  Online Songs  TV Lifestyle  Longwalks App Newspaper Subscription Food News Times Prime Whats Hot top trends Omicron Variant in India Live Assembly Elections 2022 Live Covid Deaths in India Winter Olympics 2022 Yash Dhull India Covid Cases Asaduddin Owaisi Lionel Messi Yogi Adityanath Delhi Schools Reopen News JKBOSE Class12th Winter Zone Result 2021 UP News Delhi Night Curfew News Cryptocurrency Exchange in India How to Buy Bitcoin Ethereum cryptocurrency in India Cryptocurrency Price in India Horoscope Today services Ads 2 Book ET Money Finance App CouponDunia Dineout Magicbricks Techgig Times Jobs Bollywood News Times Mobile Gadgets Now Careers Colombia Popular Categories Headlines Sports News Business News India News World News Bollywood News Health & Fitness Tips Indian TV Shows Celebrity Photos Popular News hot on the web Farhan Akhtar Indian Comedian Hrithik Roshan Happy Vasant Panchami 2022 Tamannaah Bhatia Rashmika Mandanna Deepika Padukone Omicron Symptoms Silambarasan Trending topics Vasant Panchami Wishes Madhubala South Actress Rashmika Mandanna Omicron Variant Sunil Grover Malaika Arora Samantha Ruth Prabhu Home Raj Kundra South Indian actresses Education Looop Lapeta Review Rannvijay Singha Mobile Phonesunder 10000 Mobile Phones under 15000 Mobile Phone under 20000 BSNL Bharat Fiber Broadband Plan Vivo Y55s Laptops under 30000 WiFi Routers Tablets under 15000 Laptops under 40000 Follow us on facebook twitter rss feed youtube download toi app android iphone BlackBerry ipad windows phone About us  Create Your Own Ad  Terms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy  Privacy policy  Privacy policy  Advertise with us  RSS  Newsletter  Feedback  ePaper  Sitemap  Archives  Do Not Sell Data Cookie Policy DNPA Code of Ethics Copyright © 2022 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

 Top Questions When was the game of cricket invented? Cricket is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th century as a game in which country boys bowled at a tree stump or the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. When was the first Test match played? The first Test match was played between Australia and England in Melbourne in 1877, with Australia winning. When Australia again won at the Oval at Kennington, London, in 1882, the  Sporting Times  printed an obituary notice announcing that English cricket would be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia, thus creating the “play for the Ashes.” When was the International Women’s Cricket Council formed? The International Women’s Cricket Council was formed in 1958 by Australia, England, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and South Africa, and later included India, Denmark, and several West Indian islands. How many players are there on a cricket team? Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. As there are 11 players on a team and 2 of them must be the bowler and wicketkeeper, only 9 other positions can be occupied at any one time.  cricket ,   England ’s national summer sport, which is now played throughout the world, particularly in Australia, India, Pakistan, the  West Indies , and the  British Isles . Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The field is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the  pitch , that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres) wide. Two sets of three sticks, called  wickets , are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across the top of each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails. The sides take turns at  batting  and  bowling  (pitching); each turn is called an “innings” (always plural). Sides have one or two innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of the match, the object being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an “over”), then a different player from his side  bowls  six balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket. cricket field Location of wickets and principal playing positions on a cricket field. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. There are two batsman up at a time, and the batsman being bowled to (the striker) tries to  hit  the ball away from the wicket. A hit may be defensive or offensive. A defensive hit may protect the wicket but leave the batsmen no time to run to the opposite wicket. In that case the batsmen need not run, and play will resume with another bowl. If the batsman can make an offensive hit, he and the second batsman (the nonstriker) at the other wicket change places. Each time both batsmen can reach the opposite wicket, one run is scored. Providing they have enough time without being caught out and dismissed, the batsmen may continue to cross back and forth between the wickets, earning an additional run for each time both reach the opposite side. There is an outside boundary around the cricket field. A ball hit to or beyond the boundary scores four points if it hits the ground and then reaches the boundary, six points if it reaches the boundary from the air (a fly ball). The team with the highest number of runs wins a match. Should both teams be unable to complete their number of innings before the time allotted, the match is declared a draw. Scores in the hundreds are common in cricket. Matches in cricket can range from informal weekend afternoon encounters on village greens to top-level international contests spread over five days in Test matches and played by leading professional players in grand stadiums.

See all videos for this article Cricket is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th century as a game in which country boys bowled at a tree stump or at the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. This gate consisted of two uprights and a crossbar resting on the slotted tops; the crossbar was called a  bail  and the entire gate a  wicket . The fact that the bail could be dislodged when the wicket was struck made this preferable to the  stump , which name was later applied to the hurdle uprights. Early manuscripts differ about the size of the wicket, which acquired a third stump in the 1770s, but by 1706 the pitch—the area between the wickets—was 22 yards long.   The  ball , once presumably a stone, has remained much the same since the 17th century. Its modern weight of between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (156 and 163 grams) was established in 1774.   The primitive  bat  was no doubt a shaped branch of a tree, resembling a modern hockey stick but considerably longer and heavier. The change to a straight bat was made to defend against length bowling, which had evolved with cricketers in Hambledon, a small village in southern England. The bat was shortened in the handle and straightened and broadened in the blade, which led to  forward play, driving, and cutting . As bowling technique was not very advanced during this period, batting dominated bowling through the 18th century.     The early years   The earliest reference to an 11-a-side match, played in Sussex for a stake of 50 guineas, dates from 1697. In 1709 Kent met Surrey in the first recorded intercounty match at Dartford, and it is probable that about this time a code of laws (rules) existed for the conduct of the game, although the earliest known version of such rules is dated 1744. Sources suggest that cricket was limited to the southern counties of England during the early 18th century, but its popularity grew and eventually spread to London, notably to the  Artillery Ground, Finsbury, which saw a famous match between Kent and All-England in 1744. Heavy betting and disorderly crowds were common at matches.   The aforementioned  Hambledon Club, playing in Hampshire on Broadhalfpenny Down, was the predominant cricket force in the second half of the 18th century before the rise of the  Marylebone Cricket Club  (MCC) in London. Formed from a cricket club that played at White  Conduit  Fields, the club moved to  Lord’s Cricket Ground  in St. Marylebone borough in 1787 and became the MCC and in the following year published its first revised code of laws. Lord’s, which was named after its founder, Thomas Lord, has had three locations over its history. Moving to the current ground in St. John’s Wood in 1814, Lord’s became the headquarters of world cricket.   In 1836 the first match of North counties versus South counties was played, providing clear evidence of the spread of cricket. In 1846 the  All-England XI, founded by  William Clarke of Nottingham, began touring the country, and from 1852, when some of the leading professionals (including John Wisden, who later compiled the first of the famous Wisden almanacs on cricketing) seceded to form the  United All-England XI, these two teams monopolized the best cricket talent until the rise of county cricket. They supplied the players for the first English touring team overseas in 1859.

 cricket ,  (family Gryllidae),  any of approximately 2,400  species  of leaping insects (order Orthoptera) that are worldwide in distribution and known for the musical chirping of the male. Crickets vary in length from 3 to 50 mm (0.12 to 2 inches). They have thin antennae, hind legs modified for jumping, three-jointed tarsal (foot) segments, and two slender abdominal sensory appendages (called cerci). The two forewings are stiff and leathery, and the two long, membranous hind wings are used in flying. Male crickets produce musical chirping sounds by rubbing a scraper located on one forewing along a row of about 50 to 250 teeth on the opposite forewing. The frequency of the chirps depends on the number of teeth struck per second and varies from 1,500 cycles per second in the largest cricket species to nearly 10,000 cycles per second in the smallest. The most common cricket songs are the calling song, which attracts the female; the courtship, or mating, song, which induces the female to copulate; and the fighting chirp, which repels other males. Both sexes have highly sensitive organs on the forelegs for  sound reception . There is a direct relationship between the rate of cricket chirps and temperature, with the rate increasing with increasing temperature.

 Most female crickets insert eggs into soil or plant stems with their long, slender ovipositors, sometimes causing serious plant damage. In northern latitudes most crickets mature and lay eggs in the fall. The nymphs hatch in the spring and become adults after 6 to 12 molts; adults ordinarily live 6 to 8 weeks. The  field cricket  (genus  Gryllus ) and the  house cricket ( Acheta,  formerly  Gryllus, domesticus ) of the subfamily Gryllinae are stout-bodied and black or brown and often dig shallow burrows. They may feed on plants, animals, clothes, and each other. The field cricket (also called the black cricket) is common in fields and yards and sometimes enters buildings. The house cricket, introduced into  North America  from  Europe , has a light-coloured head with dark cross bands and may be found in buildings and refuse heaps. Widely distributed, house and field crickets chirp day and night. They are used as fish bait in some countries and are also used in biology laboratories.  Gryllus  is often referred to in poetry and prose. Ground crickets (subfamily Nemobiinae, or sometimes Gryllinae), approximately 12 mm long, are commonly found in pastures and wooded areas. Their song is a series of soft, high-pitched trills. The  striped ground cricket ( Nemobius vittatus ) has three dark stripes on its abdomen. Tree crickets (subfamily Oecanthinae) are white or green in colour and have transparent wings. Although tree crickets are  beneficial  to humans because they  prey  on aphids, the female injures twigs during egg placement. The song of most tree crickets is a long trill. The  snowy tree cricket  ( Oecanthus fultoni ) is popularly known as the thermometer cricket because the approximate temperature (Fahrenheit) can be estimated by counting the number of chirps in 15 seconds and adding 40. Tree- and bush-inhabiting crickets usually sing at night, whereas weed-inhabiting crickets sing both day and night. snowy tree cricket Snowy tree cricket ( Oecanthus fultoni ). Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Ant-loving crickets (subfamily Myrmecophilinae) are minute (3 to 5 mm long), wingless, and humpbacked. They live in ant nests.  Wingless bush crickets (subfamily Mogoplistinae) are generally found on bushes or under debris in sandy tropical areas near water. They are slender crickets, 5 to 13 mm long, wingless or with small wings, and are covered with translucent scales that rub off easily.  Sword-bearing, or winged bush, crickets (subfamily Trigonidiinae) are 4 to 9 mm long and brown and possess a sword-shaped ovipositor. They are characteristically found in bushes near a pond. Crickets play a large role in  myth  and superstition. Their presence is equated with good fortune and intelligence; harming a cricket supposedly causes misfortune. In East Asia male crickets are caged for their songs, and cricket fighting has been a favourite sport in  China  for hundreds of years. Insects called crickets but not of the cricket family Gryllidae include the camel cricket,  Jerusalem cricket ,  mole cricket , and  pygmy sand cricket .
