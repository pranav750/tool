 Earn 5-9% per week with bitcoin investment trust traders Hello, we are a group of OTC bitcoin traders.  
We buy bitcoins at market price and sell them to big OTC buyers for a huge markup.  
Recently we aquired a new client, who wishes to put many millions of his cash into bitcoin using only our service because we can be more discreet than an exchange. 
The only problem is we lack the liquidity to do so. 
If we only use our own money in the process, it would take years, time our client does not have. 
Since we can buy bitcoins and sell them for 10%+ markup many times per month, we can provide 5-9% weekly interest on any money people might be willing to lend us! 
Let's earn together, invest some amount with us today so we can work for our millionaere client, and we will drop 5-9% profit in your wallet every week. 
Feel free to reinvest those 5-9%, to make even larger profits. 
And if you want your initial investment amount back, we can send it back at any time, we only need a few days at most in case we are mostly in cash at that moment.

 Earn up to 50% per month with bitcoin mining We run bitcoin miners since many years. 
Recently we found a way to receive stolen electricity for our new datacenter we are building in a small country we can not name. Everyone is corrupt here, which made it easy for us. 
This gives us a huge advantage to other bitcoin miners, and basically free profits. 
The only problem is that we don't have enough money to order as many mining hardware as we could run. 
This is your chance to profit too. 
Just invest in a Dark Mining miner and get monthly payouts. 
That way we can all earn together. 
With our stolen electricity, there is 0 risk of not making a profit. 
 
Just try it for yourself, buy one of our plans and every month your profit will be in your Dark Mining bitcoin wallet. 
You can re-invest the profits if you want and compound to multiply your initial investment in just a few month. 
This offer will only last until our datacenter is full! 
Then the site will go private, with only access for existing customers! 
 
You might ask, why would we not just run away with the money? 
It is easy to answer, we can receive a lot more stolen electricity, and only together we can expand as fast as possible. 
We got no problem stealing electricity from our government, but we would never cheat on a regular person. 
Just try it with our cheapest plan and see for yourself.

 Medical Grade Cannabis Buds  We stock high quality hydroponic and organic cannabis.  We are experienced professional cannabis growers who place emphasis on the medicinal value rather than the quantity we produce.  This is why you will frequently see strains listed with a 50/50 indica-sativa ratio, as these strains are best for making the Rick Simpson Oil.

 Freshly mined virgin bitcoins Do you want to clean your bitcoins? 
 
Then don't use a bitcoin mixer, where you only get more dirty coins back. 
 
With us you can buy freshly mined new virgin bitcoins. 
 
Simply buy them in our shop and 12-24 hours later we will transfer them to the addresses you give us at checkout. 
 
You can give us as many bitcoin addresses as you want, and tell us how much bitcoins you want on each of them. 
 
We will mine the coins directly to your addresses, which means the input will be a coinbase transaction from a miner!. 
 
You can also add an additional time delay, so it will be impossible to know who bought which bitcoins. 
 
We delete all logs after the transaction!

 Your anonymous Tor Bitcoin Wallet and Laundry 
 OnionWallet Features: 
 • Free Bitcoin Mixer! You will always get get completely different Bitcoins on withdrawals with no "taint" to your recieving address. 
• Safe storage: we keep most of the bitcoins in secure encrypted offline storage. 
• Protect your funds with a transaction PIN. 
• Anonymous registration: We do not need any private data. 
• Very simple user interface, no complicated options and settings. 
• NO FEES except the bitcoin network fee! 
 
 Get started using Bitcoins in 2 simple steps: 
• Register an account on OnionWallet and write down your username, password and optionally PIN at a secure place. 
• Purchase Bitcoins to your Bitcoin address in your OnionWallet account using for example one of the following exchange services: 
 http://www.nanaimogold.com/  - Buy Bitcoins through: Cash Deposit and Westernunion internationally 
 http://localbitcoins.com/  - Buy Bitcoins locally with cash - person to person - no banks involved. 
 https://bitcoinnordic.com/  - Buy Bitcoins using wire transfer and cash in mail. 
 https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Currency_exchanges  - Big list of many more Bitcoin exchanges. 
 
 Why you should use OnionWallet: 
Bitcoin and Bitcoin wallets itself are not really anonymous, they only provide so called pseudonymity, which means as long as no one knows which Bitcoin addresses you are using, you are anonymous. 
That anonymity is easily destroyed when you deal with some party that knows your real identity, for example if you sell or buy bitcoins on an exchange. 
And with more and more exchanges and other services following AML and KYC policies, its getting really hard to stay anonymous to government agencys when dealing with bitcoins. 
OnionWallet helps you break that chain, since its hosted at a Tor hidden service, and no one knows who we are, we do not have to follow any AML and KYC policies, so we cannot be forced to give out any of our users information. 
Even if we wanted to, we do not have much information about our users since through tor we do not see any ips or other sensitive data. 
OnionWallet mixes all bitcoins, which makes tracing you on the Bitcoin blockchain impossible. 
 
 Bitcoin and Tor, a perfect team 
When using Bitcoin together with Tor you are combining the best online money with the best encryption and privacy technology available. 
Its simply not possible to know you are not under surveillance when using normal internet websites for managing your Bitcoins. 
Only a shared Bitcoin Web Wallet hosted as a Tor hidden service will provide you maximum anonymity and privacy! 
 
 Free Bitcoin Laundry, Bitcoin Washing, Bitcoin Mixer 
Launder your Bitcoins without any fees, all we charge is the network fee we pay to bitcoins miners. 
For mixing your Bitcoins, or washing them, it is best to use a Tor hidden service like OnionWallet because all mixers operating a clearnet website, including coinfog, are subject to government control.

 SW Asian #4 Heroin     
 
 
 
 The Heroin we offer comes  direct from the
importer  with no middle man 
 
 
 It is white/light beige in
color and we take great pride in the fact that  we do not cut
our product whatsoever  and we ensure that our source does
not do so either!  
 
 We would much prefer to
offer a high quality product and have repeat customers  
 
 
 
 Whats
the difference between #3 and #4 heroin?
 
 
 
 Most people know this but
we do get this asked often enough that we decided to add this
information onto the listing.
 
 
 
 The most commonly found
forms of Heroin are #3 and #4 
 
 
 No.4 grade  H eroin 
is the  PUREST  form of Heroin. It is a white powder that is
easily dissolved in water and thus readily injected. 
 
 
 
 No.3
grade  H eroin 
is a tan-coloured, granular product often referred to as Ëbrown
rock 
 The difference in color
between No.4 and No.3 grades is a result of impurities introduced
during or remaining after the manufacturing process. No.3 grade is
commonly heated and the vapors inhaled. It can be injected but it
has to be dissolved in citrus instead of water.
 
 
 
 To
keep it simple, think about it like this;
 
 
 
   #4
 H eroin 
is water soluable and  MUCH  more pure and desireable
among IV users and people who sniff whereas, #3 is for people who
prefer to smoke it.
 
 
 
 However,  #4  H eroin 
can be smoked as well (usually by adding cafeine or another
adulterant to make it burn slower)

 Rent-A-Hacker Experienced hacker offering his services! 
(Illegal) Hacking and social engineering is my business since i was 16 years old. I never had a real job, so i had the time to get really good at hacking and i made a good amount of money last +-20 years. 
I have worked for other people before, now i am also offering my services for everyone with enough cash here. 
 
 
 Prices: 
I am not doing this to make a few bucks here and there, i am not from some crappy eastern europe country and happy to scam people for 50 EUR. 
I am a professional computer expert who could earn 50-100 EUR an hour with a legal job. 
So stop reading if you don't have a serious problem worth spending some cash at. 
Prices depend a lot on the problem you want me to solve, but minimum amount for smaller jobs is 250 EUR. 
You can pay me anonymously using Bitcoin.
 
 Technical skills: 
- Web (HTML, PHP, SQL, APACHE) 
- C/C++, Assembler, Delphi 
- 0day Exploits, Highly personalized trojans, Bots, DDOS 
- Spear Phishing Attacks to get accounts from selected targets 
- Basically anything a hacker needs to be successful, if i don't know it, i'll learn it very fast 
- Anonymity: no one will ever find out who i am or anything about my clients.
 
 Social Engineering skills: 
- Very good written and spoken (phone calls) english, spanish and german. 
- If i can't hack something technically i'll make phone calls or write emails to the target to get the needed information, i have had people make things you wouldn't believe really often. 
- A lot of experience with security practices inside big corporations. 
 
 What i'll do: 
I will do anything for money, i'm not a pussy. If you want me to destroy some business or a persons life, i'll do it! 
Some examples:  
- Simply hacking something technically 
- Causing alot of technical trouble on websites / networks to disrupt their service with DDOS and other methods. 
- Economic espionage 
- Getting private information from someone 
- Ruining your opponents, business or private persons you don't like, i can ruin them financially and or get them arrested, whatever you like. 
If you want someone to get known as a child porn user, no problem. 
 
 The following prices are estimates, if i think a specific job takes more time and money i will either refund you or you will send the remaining once we talked. 
If you are unsure about which category to choose, choose the lower priced one in question. 
You will only pay for successful jobs, if i can not do anything for you i will refund you. But keep in mind depending on your target specific things might take longer and require an addition payment, but only after i can show some success.

 How to get perfectly anonymous bitcoins in 3 easy steps: 
 Step 1: 
Sign up at Dark Mixer and send bitcoins from your old wallet to your new Dark Mixer wallet. 
 
 Step 2: 
Wait a random amount of time, ideally a few days.
 
 Step 3: 
Withdraw your bitcoins as you need them to make payments. 
If you send $300 worth of bitcoins to the Dark Mixer, and withdraw in smaller parts of for example $50, $100, $80, then there will be no possibility at all to even guess which transaction is yours, and which belongs to another user.
 
 
 Why most other mixers are NOT safe at all: 
1. If they are on the clearweb, then they will be seized sooner or later, like for example bestmixer.
Even if they do not keep logs, law enforcement can monitor the server since it is no problem to find and seize clearweb servers. 
2. Most mixers do not use a wallet, you send X bitcoins to them, and they send X bitcoins minus fee back. This is super easy to deanonymize for blockchain analytics companies! 
Conclusion: Only use dark web wallets like Dark Mixer as a mixer to keep your bitcoins anonymous. 
 There are currently no fees except the bitcoin network fees for using the mixer. 
We are earning BTC from other sites and are cleaning our coins on this mixer, so we do not need a fee to run this service. 
This might change in the future and we might charge a small fee, but we will give notice in advance. 
No reason to pay a high fee to mixers which do not even work. Stay safe.

With EasyCoin you do not have to worry about anonymity and security when using Bitcoin, we take care of that. 
Our integrated mixer makes sure none of your deposited Bitcoins get sent when you make a withdrawal, but instead its using funds from other users of the wallet which makes it a true Bitcoin Mixer or Bitcoin Laundry without same coin contamination. 
We store all bitcoins encrypted and large amounts only in cold storage, which protects EasyCoin from hackers or other malicious people. 
Storing and laundering / mixing your bitcoins has never been easier. 
We respect our users privacy and do not store any information, if you are worried about someone knowing about you using Bitcoin, you can use our Tor hidden service:  http://wi3dg355dpiy2g5k.onion/

EasyCoin lets you access your bitcoins from any country and location worldwide. 
 What is Bitcoin: 
Bitcoin is an anonymous peer-to-peer cryptocurrency invented by someone who gave himself the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. 
It now has millions of users and all bitcoins together are worth over a billion US dollar. 
All you need to use Bitcoins as a payment method on the internet is a Bitcoin Wallet like EasyCoin and some website or person to buy Bitcoins from. 
But bitcoin is only truly anonymous and untraceable if you are really careful not disclosing your identity. 
Easycoin is trying to help with that and protects its users privacy by default instead of having the user take care of it like all other bitcoin wallets. 
An observer wont be able to track you on the bitcoin blockchain when you use EasyCoin bitcoin wallet. 
 How to get started: 
Create an account on EasyCoin, make sure you write down your username and password and optionally your transaction PIN at a secure place. 
Then go to the Buy Bitcoins page for a small list of websites selling bitcoins, there are dozens more, just google for "Buy Bitcoins". 
If you want to buy or sell bitcoins in a really anonymous way without using banks etc, check out localbitcoins.com for person to person bitcoin exchange.

   This split design allows the user to remain completely anonymous and mitigates the risk of DNS leaks, which reveal private information such as your web browsing history.

 Kamagra Tablets Kamagra 100mg Generic Viagraâ¢ Tablets are a very popular, successful and widely accepted treatment for erectile dysfunction. Manufactured by Ajanta Pharma in clinical 'clean room' conditions, Kamagra is produced to a high quality standard to ensure safety and effectiveness. Patients using Kamagra regularly report successful intercourse and generally continue to use the treatment.

The effective treatment time of Kamagra is 4 - 6 hours but many GPs report longer effective times.

  SHA512 Calculator 
 Token: 
   Calculate!   
 Hash:   
 
 Uses  jsSHA 1.3  by Brian Turek ( jssha.sourceforge.net ). 
 Take the above result from the Hash field and use it as  username  in your OpenVPN window. Password can be left blank. 
 This calculates your token's hash client side (using Javascript in your fave browser) so—in theory—your token will never get 'on the wires' and thus will never be seen by others. 
 This obviously requires Javascript (which is sort of the point as it keeps things on your PC as opposed to out on the wires where the NSA or whoever can scrape them off of the interwebs) so if you're using Noscript or have Javascript turned off you're pretty much better off using other methods for getting your hash. Sorry.

 Child pornography is not permitted. Links to child pornography are not permitted either, and neither are links to websites which contain a significant number of direct links to CP. 
 Flooding is not permitted. We define flooding as posting similar posts more than 3 times per hour, making a thread on a topic for which a thread already exists, or posting in such a way that it significantly changes the composition of a board. Common sense will be utilized. 
 Usage of outside memes such as pepes or wojacks is prohibited. Common sense will be utilized. 
 3DPD porn is prohibited. 
 
    These guidelines apply to all boards on nanochan except /b/ and /l/.

 Discussion of political topics is prohibited. Common sense will be utilized. 
 NSFW thread icons are prohibited. 
 
    Individual boards may set their own rules which apply to that board, and boards which do not specify their own rules typically follow the board-specific rules of /l/. However, note that the rules stated above apply to everything done on the website.

 2022-05-09: The only website not made by me that I endorse is  Cheapskate's Guide . Anybody else parading around fake quotes or other endorsements under my name is lying to you, and I do not give my approval to the content of said sites or their webmasters. 
 2022-05-01: You can tell when a "Hidden Wiki" or other Tor link list is ran by a pedo because they're seemingly incapable of correctly stylizing this website's name as "MayVaneDay", proper capitals and no spaces. If you think running banner ads to CSAM/CP sites is an ethically okay action, please consult  this image  for further advice.

 Other sites I like 
 It can be hard to find treasure in the junkyard known as the Internet, so I will catalogue the ones I've encountered here: 
 Debunking Skeptics  - Probably my favorite site on the Internet (except my own, of course ^_^). I was reading it religiously as a teenager, and it provided strong support towards my questioning of mainstream theories and their devout defenders; without that site, there would  likely be no Dig Deeper . If you liked my  Mozilla  or  Coronavirus  reports, you will feel right at home on  Debunking Skeptics . Covers many fringe topics, such as  conspiracies ,  extrasensory perception , and life after death. Mostly famous for its  total destruction  of the so-called  rational skeptics , pretty much making them look like total idiots. Sadly hasn't been updated in a long time, but all the reports in there are still very relevant today. 
 Eugene McCarthy  - Are humans the hybrids of chimpanzees and pigs? Finally, we have a scientific explanation for humanity's existence that fits the pieces extremely well together without all the pitfalls of mainstream theories. Take the pigpill! 
 Ciphers by Ritter  - Best cryptography resource out there, by a mile. Explains the basics thoroughly and in a way that's easy to understand. Debunks myths and covers stuff that other sites don't dare to touch. Clearly, the author has a deep understanding of the topic. 
 Raymond Peat's site  - Writings of biologist Ray Peat, mostly covering human physiology and nutrition, but drifting into other related topics (including relevant conspiracies) sometimes. Extremely well thought-out and researched; compared to regular nutrition sites, it's in another stratosphere. 
 Miles Mathis  - One of the best sources out there for exposing staged events such as shootings, elections, and of course the  fake pandemic . Though he tends to go on rants and sometimes spends too much time on things that don't really matter (IMO) such as numerology or some other weird patterns. Still, clearly a smart and unique guy that digs deep, even in places other people don't dare to go (check out his  Stephen Hawking report , for example - and prepare to have your mind blown to pieces). Also includes some physics stuff that allegedly refutes modern science, but I can't confirm it as I don't really understand it.

 Online Spyware Watchdog 
 The goal of this website is to classify spyware programs, so that users can be more aware that they are installing spyware. 
 
 Many "everyday" applications are actually spyware.  We take an expansive and strict stance on what constitutes spyware.  We define spyware as anything that includes telemetry, phoning home, automatic updates or is listening in without the user's knowledge or consent. 
 
 This website contains articles on popular programs with explanations of the spyware features found in them. Included are easy to understand ratings, detailed explanations, and proof, of how features of these programs can spy on the user.

 DEF CON Movie Night: 3 Days of the Condor 
  Posted 5.21.22 
 
 Join us Saturday the 21st at 8pm PDT for Sydney Pollack's 1975 spy thriller 'Three Days of the Condor'. Robert Redford plays a CIA researcher on the run and Ma Bell plays herself. We'll be hiding out in the DEF CON Discord (discord.gg/defcon) under the code name movie-night-text. 
 
 
 Check out Policy @ DEF CON! 
  Posted 5.19.22 
 
 Policy matters. The world has never been so connected, and mighty forces contend for the right to shape our digital lives. DEF CON believes the hacker community needs a voice in that process. To help people learn, connect and get involved with the leading edge of tech policy, we offer ‘ Policy @ DEF CON ’. We’ll have presentations, panels, and off-the-record evening lounges. Get yourself up to speed on the issues, connect with some of the players and maybe even get involved. The future is what we make it! 
 
 
 The DEF CON 30 Website is live! 
  Posted 5.13.22 
 
 Good news, everyone! The  DEF CON 30 official website is officially LIVE  and DEF CON season is officially IN EFFECT.  Bookmark it for a handy place to check out all of the DC30 infoz as they roll in. Check the calendar, jump into the forums, book a room - it’s all in one place.   

    Now that we’ve reached cruising altitude, you are free to shimmy excitedly around the cabin. 

    Let’s GoOOoo! 
 
 
 COVID Updates for DEF CON 30 
  Posted 5.3.22 
 
 DEF CON 30 is getting closer, and that means we’re starting to get questions about Covid-19 protocols for the in-person event. Here’s the current state of play. 

    Some things have changed since DC29. The US has largely stopped checking vaccine status for entry to indoor events, owing at least partly to the knowledge that the vaccines serve more to prevent severe disease than to curtail transmission. COVID-19 testing is now mostly done privately with widely available at-home kits. 

    But most things haven’t changed. There are still new variants on the move. There are still spikes in transmission and hospitalization. Masks are still the most effective way to protect people in indoor events. 

    Barring a major change in the situation, we will not check proof of vaccination, but we will keep last year's mask requirement in place for DEF CON 30. Protecting the community is our first priority, and we want to make sure that everyone is as safe as we can make them. Everyone includes the healthy, the vulnerable and those who have immune compromised loved ones they need to protect. 

    Thank you for all you did to protect each other last year, and with your help we’ll do it again this year. 
 
 
 Training Coming to DEF CON 30, Call for Training is Open! 
  Posted 4.14.22 
 
 The wait is over - we’re ready to announce the Call for Trainers!  

    This year we’re adding DEF CON Training – intensive, two-day courses of study aimed at building specific skills. In some cases, these courses will even carry a certification. The Trainings will be held August 15-16, the Monday and Tuesday after DEF CON. 

    We’re looking for unique, technical, and practical presentations from trainers with deep knowledge of their subject. If that’s you, we’re offering: 

    - 50/50 split of the gross income. 
    - Optional test where students demonstrate their skill for a certificate. 

    All the info you need to apply is on the  Call for Training  page.  Get your applications in early – we look forward to seeing what you’ve got to share. 
 
 
 New Payment Option for DEF CON 30! 
  Posted 3.25.22 
 
 DEF CON is a cash-at-the-door kind of conference. Paying in cash helps protect your privacy, and search warrants can't vacuum up PII we don't collect. You will always be able to lay down US dollars in the reg line and collect your badge. 

    Still, the experience of DC29 taught us a few things. Some of our attendees work DEF CON into their business travel schedule, and the option to pre-reg with a credit card over the web made things much easier for them. Some of our attendees need to manage a group purchase, or want a more detailed receipt. 

    For everyone who fits into those categories, we’re happy to announce that we’re keeping the option of online registration. Starting Monday, March 28th, you’ll be able to use  shop.defcon.org  to buy your ticket and get your receipt. We hope the online option makes the process more streamlined for those who need it. We thank people for their patience and feedback as we navigate the changing landscape. 

    The price for DEF CON 30 is $360, with a processing fee of $9.66 added to online orders. 
 Fine print: Currently we cannot provide beachballs and pizza to the online purchasing experience. For that, you’re gonna need LineCon. 
 
 
 DEF CON Movie Night: Dark Star! 
  Posted 3.16.22 
 
 DEF CON Movie Night this Saturday will feature some more 70s sci-fi with John Carpenter’s ‘Dark Star’ from ’74. Join us 3-19 at 8pm PDT in the #defcon discord ( discord.gg/defcon ). We’ll be in the movie-night-text channel. 
 
 
 Villages for DEF CON 30! 
  Posted 3.15.22 
 
 The list of  DEF CON 30 villages on the Forums  has been updated! Stop by to  check out the full complement of village goodness we're offering this year. Comment, like, subscribe, volunteer to help out - but mostly get amped. #defcon30approaches. 
 
 
 Coming soon: Call for Training! 
  Posted 3.11.22 
 
 We’re excited to announce something new on the menu for DC 30 - DEF CON Training! We’re launching a lineup of intense two-day trainings taking place August 15-16 in the same venue, and we’re looking for trainers! 
 WHAT:  DEF CON We’re seeking Trainers for two-day training sessions right after DEF CON 30.  
 WHEN:  August 15-16, the Monday and Tuesday after DEF CON 30. 
 WHERE:  Same location, the Caesars Forum. 
 WHY:  For DEF CON attendees  who love our free Workshop series but wish they could get an even deeper, more focused dive and maybe even a certificate. Like everything we do at DEF CON, we hope it will help to build and strengthen the hacker community and spread the kind of knowledge that makes the world more open and secure. 

    DEF CON Training will offer two-day paid training courses in the $1-$3k price range. We’re looking for unique, technical, and practical presentations from trainers with deep knowledge of their subject. If that’s you, we’re offering: 


    - 50/50 split of  the gross income. 
    - Optional test where students demonstrate their skill for a certificate. 

    Interested? We will launch the Trainer submission form later this month! If you have questions, drop us a line at info@defcon.org.

  Posted 2.1.22 
 
 You know how you can tell it’s DEF CON season? The Calls. When you hear the distinctive warble of the DEF CON Content calls, you know what’s up. It’s like the first robin of spring, if robins were cooler and more hacker-focused.

 Demo Labs 

    Get your open source project in front of the knowledgable, curious humans of DEF CON. Get valuable feedback, find accomplices and raise your project’s profile. We provide the floor space and the audience, you provide the timely submission. 

    The DEF CON machine is revving up, and DC30 will be here before you know it. Don’t miss your chance to get involved. The community is waiting to see what you’ve got to share.

 Enter the DEF CON 30 Artwork Contest! 
  Posted 11.17.21 
 
 Now that the DEF CON 30 Theme is out there in the world, it’s time to go pencils up on the DEF CON Art Contest! 
 This year’s theme is ‘Hacker Homecoming’ , and you can read all about it on the DEF CON Forums. It’s a theme meant to celebrate our community’s much awaited reunion next August. It’s also meant to reference the 30th Anniversary we’re celebrating, which is a pretty big deal for a hacker conference. 

    So if you’ve got some art skills, you’ve got a luxurious 7+ months to get your take on the theme in to us. There’s so much time between now and the June 1 deadline that you could probably learn a brand new art style in which to make your submission. You can drop as many submissions to  pictures@defcon.org  as you want, so enter early and often. 
 ### Theme: 


    We are looking for artwork that reflects a spirit of community and reunion. We’re looking for art that combines the 90’s hacker aesthetic of DEF CON’s history and our tribe’s 21st century future. We’re looking for your vision and vibes.  

    We hope you’ll take in the information in  the style guide , but we hope that you’ll use that as a launching pad and not a set of limits. We want to see where you can take these ideas. 
 ### Guidelines: 


    300 DPI. Convert type to outlines where applicable. Trust your instincts - we’re looking for genuine energy, not technical perfection. We want to share and amplify the artists in our community. If tlhat’s you, get your ideas down. If that’s not you yet, could it be? You’ve got a few months to find out.
     
    Entries will be placed on the DEF CON Forums for voting, and there will be prizes. There will also be gratitude, and opportunities to inspire others with your special way of seeing the world. We can’t wait to see what you’ll make! 
 
 
 DEF CON 30 Theme: Hacker Homecoming 
  Posted 11.12.21 
 
 This has been a crazy couple of years. 

    A global pandemic turned DEF CON 28 into DEF CON Safe Mode.  Some easing of the restrictions and some strict attendance rules gave us a hybrid con for DC29. An improvement, to be sure, but something short of a full DEF CON experience.  

    We want  DEF CON 30 to have the energy of a reunion. We’ll be back togeher in a brand spanking new venue. We’ll be thirty years old - an amazing milestone for a hacker conference under any circumstances. In honor of all that, we’re calling DEF CON 30 ‘Hacker Homecoming’. 

    The first reason is that it’s literally a return home. After two years of separation, we’re looking forward to having more of our family under one roof, under the Vegas late summer sun. 

    There’s also a North American tradition called ‘Homecoming’.  Secondary schools and colleges invite luminary alums back for a big celebration of the school’s history and a toast to its future. We intend to do just that for DC30. We’ll have some surprise guests from DEF CON’s illustrious past on hand to talk about the amazing places their life has taken them since joining the DC Community. We’ll also be laying out some of the map forward from our 30th Anniversary. 

    So please join us in the Caesar’s Forums if you can, and on the Discord if you can’t.  Maybe even pack a fancy outfit for the homecoming dance. It’s high time for a reunion. 
 Design Inspiration 
 This year’s theme is about celebrating the past and getting geeked about the future, so we’re looking for smooth integration of old school hacker stylee with future vibes.  

    We took the color palette inspiration from arguably the most iconic DEF CON image of all time: the rooftop photo from DEF CON 1. 

    The photo is amazing for any number of reasons, but the most important is that even though it screams early 90s hacker culture, it also shows some of the essence of what DEF CON is even in the 2020s. It’s still a gathering of extraordinary digital misfits going Voltron in the Vegas night.  

    The fonts were also selected to be like a homecoming celebration, with some reverence for the past, some excitement about the future. The past is represented by the very 90s CityPop and Geom and the future by the futristic minimalism of Open Sans. 
 Homework 
 As always, we’ll be sharing movies, books, music and other random media to get you in the right frame of mind for maximum DEF CON. This year we’re even giving you an extra few months to get through the syllabus. Watch the DEF CON site for additions to all the lists. Pencils UP!

 Air Monitors Alone Won’t Save Communities From Toxic Industrial Air Pollution 
 Calvert City, Kentucky, has long had what people in other toxic hot spots have been begging for: monitors to prove they’re being exposed to toxic industrial air pollution. Regulators have years of evidence, but the poison in the air is only growing.

 uncensored Bible for Darknet 
 „Jesus answered: I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” - John 14:6 (NIV) 
 
 
 
 
                Hello visitor. There may be several reasons why you are here - maybe you are not familiar with the Bible and you
were just browsing through the internet and just accidentally bumped into this page, or maybe you opened
this page searching for truth. Maybe you are already familiar with the Bible and it is illegal in your country
to read or own a Bible and for that reason, this project is also available in various networks, like
 Tor ,  I2P ,  Freenet ,  Zeronet ,  IPFS  or  Lokinet  to provide uncensored access.
For whatever reason you opened this page, you are welcome here and I invite you to
feel free to start reading.


             
 
                If you are new to the Bible, I encourage you to start with the Gospel of John. It provides basic overview of who Jesus is and about His mission.
Few other books I recommend to read after the Gospel of John are Romans, Proverbs, Psalms or the book of Genesis.
Also, if you have any questions about the Bible, about the stuff you read or if you are missing translation in your language,
feel free to  contact us . So, are you ready to begin?
