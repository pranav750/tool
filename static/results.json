This contract also limits our liability to you and contains an arbitration provision and a class action waiver. \n Welcome to Keybase \n We offer a range of products and services, including this website, mobile and desktop apps for messaging and file sharing, encrypted Git and a cryptocurrency wallet (these Terms and our Privacy Policy will refer to these and all the other services and products we offer as our Services). These Terms cover your use of our Services, so please read them carefully. \n Our Business Model and Approach to Privacy \n Our mission is to help you protect your privacy and your data. Eventually, we plan to offer a paid service for corporate teams, but for now Keybase is free for everyone. You can read more about our business model and our approach to privacy  here . \n Note: When you publicly announce some of your account information, you can\u2019t delete or alter it \n We use a public blockchain to protect our users from misbehaving servers. Because of that, you can\u2019t delete your publicly announced account information and account activity once you post it. \n Your Content \n Our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive both encrypted and unencrypted content. You retain ownership of your rights in that content. In other words, if it\u2019s yours, it stays yours. \n We only have limited rights to use your content so that we can provide and improve our Services. In legal terms (sorry, but we have to say it this way): you give us rights to your content to the extent necessary to operate, promote, and improve our Services, and to develop new ones. We don\u2019t have (and can\u2019t) access your encrypted content and these rights you\u2019re granting us doesn\u2019t change that fact. \n Content from Our Users \n Much of the content available in the Services isn\u2019t from Keybase. This content is the sole responsibility of the person or entity  that makes it available. To the extent content is unencrypted, we may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don\u2019t assume that we do. \n Minimum Age \n Our Services are not directed to children, and you may not use our Services if you are under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf). \n Your Promise to Us When You Use Our Services \n You agree that you will not misuse the Services. For example, don\u2019t interfere with our Services or try to access them using methods we don\u2019t provide to you. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies, including our  Acceptable Use Policy , or if we are investigating suspected misconduct. \n Our Intellectual Property Rights \n You agree that your intellectual property rights in our Services are limited to your limited right to use our Services in accordance with these Terms and the licenses listed in our  GitHub repositories . Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms. The Services contains the open source packages listed  here . \n Your Keybase Account \n To protect your Keybase account, keep your password confidential, install Keybase on more than one device, and write down your paper key and keep it somewhere safe. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Keybase account. Don\u2019t reuse your Keybase account password anywhere else. \n We strongly encourage you to install the Keybase app on more than one device and to keep a hard copy of your paper key.  If all of your devices provisioned with Keybase are lost or damaged and you do not have a hard copy of your paper key, your Keybase account and all of your content associated with the Services will be lost forever.  All of Keybase is end-to-end encrypted (other than files that you store in your public folder and chat messages in public chats), which means that Keybase is unable to access any of your messages or content. You are responsible for keeping your Keybase account and your devices secure. \n In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You can opt out of some of those communications. \n Copyright Protection \n We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. \n We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Keybase\u2019s  policy about responding to notices . \n Modifying and Terminating our Services \n We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether. Some of our software may update automatically on your devices. \n You can stop using our Services at any time, although we\u2019ll be sorry to see you go. Keybase may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time. \n We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service. \n Updates to these Terms \n We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service. \n You should look at the terms regularly. We\u2019ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We\u2019ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. \n Business uses of our Services \n If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Keybase and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. \n Joining a Keybase Team \n When you join a team, the team administrators are able to read and delete any information you post into any chat channels in the team. They can read, edit and delete any information you put into the team KBFS folder (this is also true for any other members in the team, except \"reader\"s). They can also change your role in the team and subscribe you to chat channels within that team. \n No Warranty \n KEYBASE PROVIDES THE SERVICE \u201cAS IS\u201d, \u201cWITH ALL FAULTS\u201d AND \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, KEYBASE, ALONG WITH ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND REPRESENTATIVES, MAKE NO (AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL) REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, THAT YOUR CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR DAMAGED, OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS. IN SUCH AN EVENT SUCH EXCLUSION WILL NOT APPLY SOLELY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. \n Limitation of Liability \n TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL KEYBASE, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR: ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, COVER OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, USE OR CONTENT, HOWEVER CAUSED, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF KEYBASE HAS BEEN ADVISED AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF KEYBASE AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS, RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00). THE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS ALSO APPLY IF THIS REMEDY DOES NOT FULLY COMPENSATE YOU FOR ANY LOSSES OR FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES. IN SUCH AN EVENT THIS LIMITATION WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW. \n You acknowledge that the foregoing limitations are an essential element of the agreement between you and Keybase and that in the absence of such limitations the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms would be substantially different. \n Arbitration \n These Arbitration and Class Action Waiver sections includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read them carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below. \n You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Keybase, you will first contact Keybase and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action. \n Arbitration Agreement \n After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Keybase\u2019s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Keybase or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Keybase. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Keybase for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below. \n Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Keybase are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms. \n If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Keybase, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 28th Floor - NY, NY 10004. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at  www.adr.org  or by calling 1-800-778-7879. \n The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and New York law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. \n Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. \n The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below. \n If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Keybase and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to  legal@keybase.io  within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service. \n Class Action Waiver \n Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. \n If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Keybase each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in New York, New York. \n Miscellaneous Legal Terms \n When we refer to \u201cKeybase\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d we mean Keybase, Inc., a Delaware corporation. \n If we need to provide notice to you, we will do so via your Keybase account or the email address we have on file for you. \n If a court holds that we cannot enforce a part of these Terms as written, you and we will replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms will remain in effect. This is the entire contract between you and us regarding the Service. It supersedes any prior contract or oral or written statements regarding your use of the Service. \n You may not assign these Terms or transfer any rights to use the Service. We may assign our rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. \n Keybase and you are not legal partners or agents. These Terms are solely for your and our benefit. It is not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors. \n You must bring any claim related to these Terms or the Service within one year of the date you could first bring the claim, unless your local law requires a longer time to file claims. If it isn\u2019t filed in time, the claim is permanently barred. \n The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of laws rules. \n The failure of you or Keybase to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any of the provisions of these Terms or to exercise any rights or remedies under these Terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of your right or Keybase\u2019s right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the same will remain in full force and effect. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Keybase, 2022\n    | Available within Tor at  http://keybase5wmilwokqirssclfnsqrjdsi7jdir5wy7y7iu3tanwmtp6oid.onion \n \n install Keybase \n      |  read our blog \n      |  documentation \n      |  bug reporting \n      |  security advisories \n terms \n      &  privacy \n      &  california ccpa \n      &  acceptable use \n jobs @ keybase \n \n \n \n \n \n Please send us feedback & bug reports .\n   \n  Keybase, 2022\n    |  read our blog \n terms \n    &  privacy \n    &  security advisories \n    &  california ccpa \n    &  acceptable use \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}, {"title": "Privacypolicy | Keybase Docs", "link_status": true, "link": "http://keybase5wmilwokqirssclfnsqrjdsi7jdir5wy7y7iu3tanwmtp6oid.onion/docs/privacypolicy", "parent_link": "http://keybase5wmilwokqirssclfnsqrjdsi7jdir5wy7y7iu3tanwmtp6oid.onion", "text": "\n \n \n Privacypolicy | Keybase Docs \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Keybase Staging Server \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Install \n \n Login \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \u00d7 \n \n \n   \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Keybase \u2013 Privacy Policy \n Effective: January 9, 2020 (Posted December 9, 2019). \n At Keybase, our mission is to help you protect your privacy and your data. This privacy policy explains how we process your personal information in service of that mission. \n Summary \n We hope you will read this entire privacy policy. However, if you\u2019re in a hurry, here are the key points: \n \n Keybase won\u2019t sell or rent your data or content for any reason. \n By design, Keybase can\u2019t access, sell, transmit, or use your encrypted content. \n We use a public blockchain to protect our users from  misbehaving servers . Because of that, you can\u2019t delete your publicly announced account information and account activity once you post it to your signature chain. You can, however, revoke it. Revoking, in Keybase, means retracting the original statement, indicating that it\u2019s no longer true, or that the information has changed. \n \n Our Business Model \n We\u2019ll never run an ad-supported business. And Keybase will never sell your data. \n Eventually, we plan to offer a paid service and extra features for corporate teams, primarily. Until then, we're building a product to bring public keys to the masses. \n What personal information do we collect? \n Contact and account information : We collect the information you provide to us, such as your name, avatar picture, email address, and social media handles. Note: Keybase never requires a phone number and no longer requires an email address in order to open and maintain an account. \n Team names and membership : If you create or join a team on Keybase, we collect and store the names of the teams and subteams, their membership, and when they were formed. \n Hashed password : We collect and store information about your Keybase password that allows you to prove you know your password; that  \u201cstretched\u201d  password is sent to Keybase\u2019s servers.  See  here  for more information. \n Account activity : We collect information about your activity while using the Services, such as proving you control a certain Twitter username, announcing your public key, editing your biographical information, or editing any of your social media usernames. Some of this information is aggregated, summarized, and published into the Bitcoin blockchain in order to detect and guard against certain vulnerabilities. See \u201cDisclosures to your signature chain, the Merkle tree, and the Bitcoin blockchain\u201d below for information on how we treat this data. \n Files and Data . We collect and store files and information that you transmit to other parties using Keybase or that you elect to store on the Services.  This data is always encrypted on our servers, except for documents in your public folder and your public chats.  Those are not encrypted because you choose to make those publicly accessible. \n Do Not Track . Keybase does not collect personally identifiable information from you to track you across third-party websites. As a result, Keybase does not specifically respond to web browser Do Not Track signals. \n Unique personal identifiers . We collect and store information to identify you, such as your Keybase user ID and your IP address (which is stored only temporarily). \n Network usage and activity . We collect certain technical and analytics data, for example the type of device you\u2019re using to access our Services or the operating system you\u2019re running. Keybase is designed to store the minimum amount of technical data for the shortest time necessary in order for you to have the Services across all the devices you add. \n Interactions with us : If you email us, we may keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to the request and otherwise follow up as necessary. \n How do we use your information? \n Here\u2019s how we use your information: \n \n To provide the Services to you on all the devices you add. \n To protect our Services and users. For example, we will use it to investigate suspicious activity and attacks. \n To improve Keybase for all our users. For example, we will make development decisions based on what features our users are using. \n To communicate with you about Keybase. You can unsubscribe from those messages (unless they are specifically about your account, and then we have to send them to you). \n \n Disclosures to your signature chain, the Merkle tree and the  Bitcoin blockchain \n How and why do we use your signature chain, the Merkle tree and the Bitcoin blockchain? \n Every Keybase account has a public signature chain (called a sigchain), which is an ordered list of statements about how the account has changed over time.   Meet the sigchains!  Specifically, we announce into your sigchain your Keybase username, when you add a public key, additions or changes to your identity proofs (Twitter, Github, your website, etc.), public bitcoin address announcements, public follower statements, and device additions and revocations. The list of statements grows over time as you change and add to your account. \n Every time you add to or change data in your sigchain, those changes are aggregated with the data that everyone else on Keybase adds or changes. Those aggregated changes are summarized (aka \u201chashed\u201d) into the root of Keybase\u2019s  Merkle tree . \n Every 12 hours, that summary/hash in the Merkle tree gets published into the Bitcoin blockchain. \n We do this to increase the security of your information. It helps us to detect whether our servers have been compromised and are lying by omission or have been forked. \n Can I delete information from my sigchain? \n No. For your protection from, and detection of, hackers and other undesirable intrusions into the Services, it is not possible to delete data from your sigchain, or to change the hashes/summaries in the Merkle tree and the Bitcoin blockchain. If you want to alter information that you have provided, the previously provided information cannot be deleted and can only be revoked. \n For example, if you change your Twitter username, your old Twitter username will not be deleted from your sigchain.  Instead, you will append a new statement to your sigchain, revoking the old Twitter username.  Nobody is able to  retroactively change the hashes into the Merkle tree and Bitcoin blockchain: the fact that the hashes cannot be changed is the essence of this security feature.  All of this means that  people will be able to discover your old Twitter username by looking at your sigchain. \n Where can I find out more? \n For a technical explanation of how Keybase supports \u201crevocations\u201d instead of \u201cdeletions\u201d, how they are chained together, and how they are hashed into the Merkle tree and Bitcoin blockchain, please read our paper documentation about our  server security  and how we use the Bitcoin blockchain to  improve security . \n With whom do we share your information? \n The content of your chat messages and private files is end-to-end encrypted. Only you and those you communicate with will have the ability to see them.  Keybase and third parties do not have access to this information. \n Service providers: We use the following service providers to process your personal information: \n \n Amazon Web Services for content storage; \n Kraken.io for resizing unencrypted images such as user profile pictures; \n Note: Users can also opt in, via the chat interface, to Google location services (with the /location command) and Giphy (with the /giphy command) but those services don\u2019t receive personal information about you. \n \n Law & Order : We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with a valid legal process; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse; or (d) protect our rights, property, safety, or interest. \n Cookies : We use cookies to manage user sessions. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. Our systems currently don\u2019t respond to DNT:1 signals from browsers visiting our websites. \n Sale or transfer of our business . If we sell, merge, reorganize, enter bankruptcy, or transfer any part of our business, we may be required to share your information before and after such an event. If we do complete one of those transactions, we will notify you about any changes or transfers and this Privacy Policy will apply to the new entity. \n We do not share or sell your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes. \n Where do we store your information? \n We transfer, process, and store your personal information in the United States. \n When transferring information from the European Union and the European Economic Area, we rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and the European Economic Area to the United States. You can also learn more about Privacy Shield at  https://www.privacyshield.gov . \n JAMS is the US-based independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Privacy Shield compliance\u2014free of charge to you. We ask that you first submit any such complaints directly to us via  privacy@keybase.io . If you aren\u2019t satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at  https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield . In the event your concern still isn\u2019t addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to binding arbitration under Privacy Shield and its principles. \n The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over our compliance with the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield Principles describe our accountability for personal data that we subsequently transfer to a third-party agent. Under those Principles, we shall remain liable if third-party agents process the personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. \n How do we secure your information? \n Keybase takes reasonable security measures such as password protection, two-factor authentication for internal logins, client-side encryption, and a whitelist of employees who can deploy changes to the server, as we deem appropriate to protect the information we collect from misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Some hosting details for the technically-minded: \n \n The Services are currently hosted on Amazon\u2019s AWS; \n All data is transferred with industry standard TLS during transmission; and \n Keybase\u2019s website does not serve any 3rd party hosted JavaScript. \n \n While we do use care to protect your information, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Services, and you do so at your own risk. \n What are our lawful bases for processing your information? \n We rely on contractual necessity to process your data in order to provide and protect the Keybase Services. We rely on our legitimate interests to perform research and development. \n How long do we store your information? \n All of your chat messages and attachments are stored, encrypted, until you delete or explode them. If you delete documents from KBFS, they remain encrypted on our servers for two weeks and are then deleted. We store certain metadata for varying lengths of time in order for you to have access to Keybase over multiple devices or add new people to existing conversations. \n How can you exercise your rights over your information? \n You have control over your personal information and how it is collected, used, and shared. For example, you have a right to: \n \n Delete your account and all your associated data.  You can do this through your Keybase client. \n Erase or delete particular files and data. You can do this through your Keybase client.  You can also set messages to delete automatically. \n Change or correct personal data. You can do this through your Keybase client. \n Access and take your data to another service. You can download your files through the Keybase client. Contact us at  privacy@keybase.io  with any other questions or to make a data subject access request. \n \n Will this privacy policy ever change? \n We will update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes that reduce or negatively affect your privacy rights, you will be notified either through email or the Services. If we only make minor changes that don\u2019t reduce your rights (like changing an email address or rewording paragraphs to make them clearer), we will just post the revised policy here. Those changes will go into effect on the \u201cEffective Date\u201d shown at the top of the updated Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Services after the Effective Date means you agree to the new Privacy Policy. \n Other questions? \n Contact  privacy@keybase.io . We typically respond to requests within 30 days. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Keybase, 2022\n    | Available within Tor at  http://keybase5wmilwokqirssclfnsqrjdsi7jdir5wy7y7iu3tanwmtp6oid.onion \n \n install Keybase \n      |  read our blog \n      |  documentation \n      |  bug reporting \n      |  security advisories \n terms \n      &  privacy \n      &  california ccpa \n      &  acceptable use \n jobs @ keybase \n \n \n \n \n \n Please send us feedback & bug reports .\n   \n  Keybase, 2022\n    |  read our blog \n terms \n    &  privacy \n    &  security advisories \n    &  california ccpa \n    &  acceptable use \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}, {"title": "California Ccpa | Keybase Docs", "link_status": true, "link": "http://keybase5wmilwokqirssclfnsqrjdsi7jdir5wy7y7iu3tanwmtp6oid.onion/docs/california-ccpa", "parent_link": "http://keybase5wmilwokqirssclfnsqrjdsi7jdir5wy7y7iu3tanwmtp6oid.onion", "text": "\n \n \n California Ccpa | Keybase Docs \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Keybase Staging Server \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Install \n \n Login \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \u00d7 \n \n \n   \n \u00d7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Your California Privacy Rights \n Posted: 4/15/20 \n This notice provides additional details about the Personal Information we collect about California consumers and the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act or \u201cCCPA.\u201d \n For this notice, \u201cPersonal Information\u201d means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you.
