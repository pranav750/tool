There may be several reasons why you are here - maybe you are not familiar with the Bible and you\nwere just browsing through the internet and just accidentally bumped into this page, or maybe you opened\nthis page searching for truth. Maybe you are already familiar with the Bible and it is illegal in your country\nto read or own a Bible and for that reason, this project is also available in various networks, like\n Tor ,  I2P ,  Freenet ,  Zeronet  or  IPFS  to provide uncensored access.\nFor whatever reason you opened this page, you are welcome here and I invite you to\nfeel free to start reading.\n\n\n             \n \n                If you are new to the Bible, I encourage you to start with the Gospel of John. It provides basic overview of who Jesus is and about His mission.\nFew other books I recommend to read after the Gospel of John are Romans, Proverbs, Psalms or the book of Genesis.\nAlso, if you have any questions about the Bible, about the stuff you read or if you are missing translation in your language,\nfeel free to  contact us .
