  SHA512 Calculator 
 Token: 
   Calculate!   
 Hash:   
 
 Uses  jsSHA 1.3  by Brian Turek ( jssha.sourceforge.net ). 
 Take the above result from the Hash field and use it as  username  in your OpenVPN window. Password can be left blank. 
 This calculates your token's hash client side (using Javascript in your fave browser) so—in theory—your token will never get 'on the wires' and thus will never be seen by others. 
 This obviously requires Javascript (which is sort of the point as it keeps things on your PC as opposed to out on the wires where the NSA or whoever can scrape them off of the interwebs) so if you're using Noscript or have Javascript turned off you're pretty much better off using other methods for getting your hash. Sorry.

 A  heap overflow ,  heap overrun , or  heap smashing  is a type of  buffer overflow  that occurs in the  heap  data area. Heap overflows are exploitable in a different manner to that of  stack-based overflows . Memory on the heap is  dynamically allocated  at  runtime  and typically contains program data. Exploitation is performed by corrupting this data in specific ways to cause the application to overwrite internal structures such as  linked list   pointers . The canonical heap overflow technique overwrites dynamic memory allocation linkage (such as  malloc  metadata) and uses the resulting pointer exchange to overwrite a program  function pointer .
 For example, on older versions of  Linux , two buffers allocated next to each other on the heap could result in the first buffer overwriting the second buffer's metadata. By setting the in-use bit to zero of the second buffer and setting the length to a small negative value which allows null bytes to be copied, when the program calls  free()  on the first buffer it will attempt to merge these two buffers into a single buffer. When this happens, the buffer that is assumed to be freed will be expected to hold two  pointers  FD and BK in the first 8 bytes of the formerly allocated buffer. BK gets written into FD and can be used to overwrite a pointer.

 Consequences [ edit ] 
 An accidental overflow may result in data corruption or unexpected behavior by any process that accesses the affected memory area. On  operating systems  without  memory protection , this could be any process on the system.
 For example, a  Microsoft   JPEG   GDI+  buffer overflow vulnerability could allow remote execution of code on the affected machine. [1] 
 iOS jailbreaking  often uses heap overflows to gain  arbitrary code execution .
 
 Detection and prevention [ edit ] 
 As with buffer overflows there are primarily three ways to protect against heap overflows. Several modern  operating systems  such as Windows and  Linux  provide some implementation of all three.
 
 Prevent execution of the payload by separating the code and data, typically with hardware features such as  NX-bit 
 Introduce randomization so the heap is not found at a fixed offset, typically with  kernel  features such as ASLR ( Address Space Layout Randomization ) 
 Introduce sanity checks into the heap manager 
 Since version 2.3.6 the  GNU libc  includes protections that can detect heap overflows after the fact, for example by checking  pointer  consistency when calling  unlink . However, those protections against prior exploits were almost immediately shown to also be exploitable. [2] [3]  In addition, Linux has included support for  ASLR  since 2005, although  PaX  introduced a better implementation years before. Also Linux has included support for NX-bit since 2004.
 Microsoft  has included protections against heap resident buffer overflows since April 2003 in  Windows Server 2003  and August 2004 in  Windows XP  with  Service Pack 2 . These mitigations were safe unlinking and heap entry header cookies. Later versions of Windows such as  Vista , Server 2008 and Windows 7 include: Removal of commonly targeted data structures, heap entry metadata randomization, expanded role of heap header cookie, randomized heap base address,  function pointer  encoding, termination of heap corruption and algorithm variation. Normal Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and ASLR also help to mitigate this attack. [4]

 DeepDNS ? 
 DeepDNS is part of cryptostorm's internal DNS infrastructure. 
It's a combination of several different DNS related programs that provide our users with direct access to some darknet resources (.onion and .i2p) in a transparent way, so no additional software is required. 
It also provides more secure alternatives to traditional DNS via DNSCrypt. 
All of our DeepDNS servers also act as regular public DNS servers. 
This is mostly so our users can protect their DNS when they're connecting to cryptostorm, but it's also for anyone else who wants to use DNS servers that don't log their activities. 
 2021 update: 
It looks like DNSChain hasn't been updated in several years, so we're dropping support for that (and .bit, .eth, .dns, etc.). The below text has been updated to reflect the current DeepDNS setup.  We do still support transparent .onion and .i2p , dropping DNSChain support only means no more .bit/.eth/.dns. 
 If you're looking for the current DeepDNS IPs, you can find them by resolving ""public.deepdns.net"", or by going to  https://cryptostorm.is/dns.txt 
 techie explaination 
 In the rest of this README, two abbreviations are used for the sake of brevity: 
 
 CS =  cryptostorm 
 ddns =  deepDNS 
 
 For CS clients, DNS over ddns normally happens as such: 
 
 
 client connects to CS, OpenVPN pushes the exit node's ddns IP to the client, client then uses that for all DNS requests. 
 
 
 client tries to resolve whatever. 
 
 
 DNS request hits the internet facing  powerdns-recursor  process. 
 
 
 
 Our pdns-recursor uses this in it's config: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 forward-zones=onion.=127.0.0.1:5335 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 auth-zones=i2p=/var/zones/i2p 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 That translates to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 send DNS requests for whatever.onion to the DNS server at 127.0.0.1:5335 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 use the zone file /var/zones/i2p for DNS requests for whatever.i2p 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 127.0.0.1:5335 is tor, or more specifically, a tor instance with ""DNSPort 127.0.0.1:5335"" in it's torrc. 
 
 
 the /var/zones/i2p zone file contains the single line: *.i2p. IN A 10.98.0.1 
 
 
 so any request for an .i2p domain will resolve to 10.98.0.1, which is handled by iptables: 
 
 
 
 iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT     -d 10.98.0.1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination ddns-ip:4444 
 
 
 
 
 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 10.98.0.1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination ddns-ip:4444 
 
 
 
 The server on port 4444 is an http proxy the actual i2pd daemon has built-in 
 
 
 The powerdns-recursor servers mentioned above are internet accessible.
That's intentional.
Anyone who wants to their system to use our DNS servers before they connect can do so.
They are public DNS servers, and we maintain a full list of all the  deepDNS public resolver IPs , which can also be enumerated via a DNS lookup of ""public.deepdns.net"". 
Obviously, you would need to be connected to  cryptostorm  in order to use the transparent .i2p/.onion feature described above. 
 For anyone who wants more security than regular DNS offers (which is basically none), DNSCrypt is also supported. 
Server-side, we run  https://github.com/jedisct1/encrypted-dns-server  on TCP port 443 of every DeepDNS IP, and we also supported Anonymized DNSCrypt relays. See  https://cryptostorm.is/blog/anondns  for more info on that.

 In  information security ,  computer science , and other fields, the  principle of least privilege  ( PoLP ), also known as the  principle of minimal privilege  or the  principle of least authority , requires that in a particular  abstraction layer  of a computing environment, every module (such as a  process , a  user , or a  program , depending on the subject) must be able to access only the information and  resources  that are necessary for its legitimate purpose. [1]

 Details [ edit ] 
 The principle means giving a  user account  or process only those privileges which are essential to perform its intended function. For example, a user account for the sole purpose of creating backups does not need to install software: hence, it has rights only to run backup and backup-related applications. Any other privileges, such as installing new software, are blocked. The principle applies also to a personal computer user who usually does work in a normal user account, and opens a privileged, password protected account only when the situation absolutely demands it.
 When applied to  users , the terms  least user access  or  least-privileged user account  (LUA) are also used, referring to the concept that all  user accounts  should run with as few  privileges  as possible, and also launch  applications  with as few privileges as possible.
 The principle of least privilege is widely recognized as an important design consideration in enhancing the protection of data and functionality from faults ( fault tolerance ) and malicious behavior ( computer security ).
 Benefits of the principle include:
 
 Better system stability. When code is limited in the scope of changes it can make to a system, it is easier to test its possible actions and interactions with other applications. In practice for example, applications running with restricted rights will not have access to perform operations that could crash a machine, or adversely affect other applications running on the same system. 
 Better system security. When code is limited in the system-wide actions it may perform, vulnerabilities in one application cannot be used to exploit the rest of the machine. For example, Microsoft states “Running in standard user mode gives customers increased protection against inadvertent system-level damage caused by "" shatter attacks "" and  malware , such as  root kits ,  spyware , and undetectable  viruses ”. [2] 
 Ease of deployment. In general, the fewer privileges an application requires, the easier it is to deploy within a larger environment. This usually results from the first two benefits, applications that install device drivers or require elevated security privileges typically have additional steps involved in their deployment. For example, on Windows a solution with no  device drivers  can be run directly with no installation, while device drivers must be installed separately using the Windows installer service in order to grant the driver elevated privileges. [3] 
 In practice, there exist multiple competing definitions of true least privilege. As  program complexity  increases rapidly, so do the number of potential issues, rendering a predictive approach impractical. Examples include the values of variables it may process, addresses it will need, or the precise time such things will be required. Object capability systems allow, for instance, deferring granting a single-use privilege until the time when it will be used. Currently, the closest practical approach is to eliminate privileges that can be manually evaluated as unnecessary. The resulting set of privileges typically exceeds the true minimum required privileges for the process.
 Another limitation is the granularity of control that the operating environment has over privileges for an individual process. [4]  In practice, it is rarely possible to control a process's access to memory, processing time, I/O device addresses or modes with the precision needed to facilitate only the precise set of privileges a process will require.
 The original formulation is from  Jerome Saltzer : [5] 
 
  Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job. —  Jerome Saltzer ,  Communications of the ACM 
 Peter J. Denning , in his paper ""Fault Tolerant Operating Systems"", set it in a broader perspective among four fundamental principles of fault tolerance.
 Dynamic assignments of privileges was earlier discussed by  Roger Needham  in 1972. [6] [7] 
 Historically, the oldest instance of least privilege is probably the source code of  login.c , which begins execution with  super-user  permissions and—the instant they are no longer necessary—dismisses them via  setuid()  with a non-zero argument as demonstrated in the  Version 6 Unix   source code. 
 
 Implementation [ edit ] 
 The  kernel  always runs with maximum privileges since it is the  operating system  core and has hardware access. One of the principal responsibilities of an operating system, particularly a multi-user operating system, is management of the hardware's availability and requests to access it from running  processes . When the kernel crashes, the mechanisms by which it maintains  state  also fail. Therefore, even if there is a way for the  CPU  to recover without a  hard reset , security continues to be enforced, but the operating system cannot properly respond to the failure because it was not possible to detect the failure. This is because kernel execution either halted or the  program counter  resumed execution from somewhere in an endless, and—usually—non-functional  loop . [ citation needed ]  This would be akin to either experiencing  amnesia  (kernel execution failure) or being trapped in a closed maze that always returns to the starting point (closed loops).
 
   The principle of least privilege demonstrated by privilege rings for the  Intel x86 
 If execution picks up after the crash by loading and running  trojan code , the author of the trojan code can usurp control of all processes. The principle of least privilege forces code to run with the lowest privilege/permission level possible. This means that the code that resumes the code execution-whether trojan or simply code execution picking up from an unexpected location—would not have the ability to perform malicious or undesirable processes. One method used to accomplish this can be implemented in the  microprocessor  hardware. For example, in the  Intel x86  architecture the manufacturer designed four (ring 0 through ring 3) running ""modes"" with graduated degrees of access-much like  security clearance  systems in defence and intelligence agencies. [ citation needed ] 
 As implemented in some operating systems, processes execute with a  potential privilege set  and an  active privilege set . [ citation needed ]  Such privilege sets are inherited from the parent as determined by the semantics of  fork () . An  executable file  that performs a privileged function—thereby technically constituting a component of the  TCB , and concomitantly termed a trusted program or trusted process—may also be marked with a set of privileges. This is a logical extension of the notions of  set user ID  and  set group ID . [ citation needed ]  The inheritance of  file privileges  by a process are determined by the semantics of the  exec ()  family of  system calls . The precise manner in which potential process privileges, actual process privileges, and file privileges interact can become complex. In practice, least privilege is practiced by forcing a process to run with only those privileges required by the task. Adherence to this model is quite complex as well as error-prone.
 
 Similar principles [ edit ] 
 The  Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria  (TCSEC) concept of  trusted computing base  (TCB) minimization is a far more stringent requirement that is only applicable to the functionally strongest assurance classes,  viz. , B3 and A1 (which are  evidentiarily  different but  functionally  identical).
 Least privilege is often associated with  privilege bracketing : that is, assuming necessary privileges at the last possible moment and dismissing them as soon as no longer strictly necessary, therefore ostensibly reducing fallout from erroneous code that unintentionally exploits more privilege than is merited. Least privilege has also been interpreted in the context of distribution of  discretionary access control  (DAC) permissions, for example asserting that giving user U read/write access to file F violates least privilege if U can complete his authorized tasks with only read permission.
